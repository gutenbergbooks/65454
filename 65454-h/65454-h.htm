<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> compiling the miscellaneous array of facts embodied in the pen sketches
arranged within the covers of this book, the principal object striven for
has been to seek out, set down and thereby rescue from forgetfulness
and the danger of extinction, a grist of information pertaining to local railway
life in Canada and to men identified with international railway affairs.</p>

<p>The data is necessarily incomplete, owing to the embarrassment of available
material clamoring for place and because the railways’ numerous departments
harbor scores of brilliant officials and a host of yet undecorated aides,
but the biographies, particularly, have revived some interesting early history
which was the parent and foundation of present-day conditions.</p>

<p>The concentrated effort and predominant characteristics which eventually
won prominence for the gentlemen herein featured may be an incentive and
safeguard to young men and the journal is deferentially submitted for perusal
to all readers who appreciate how paramount among vital essentials to progress
and comfort are the railroads, but it is especially dedicated to those
cosmopolitans whose duties are so closely interwoven with the daily transport
of people and their natural and manufactured products.</p>

<p>In no other fields of endeavor does the spirit of genuine <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cameraderie</i> and
the bonds of unconventional fraternity exist more generally than among
railway men in all branches—among allies and competitors alike—and it is
hoped the work will prove to this irregular army of “thoroughbreds” a book
of reference, a reminder later on of former devotees of the magnetic game
and also perpetuate those splendid standards, enjoyable gatherings and ever
changing activities of their day.</p>

<p>For the courtesy of reprinting privileges, where my earlier articles are
concerned, I am indebted to “Busy Man’s Magazine,” “Canadian Century,”
“McLean’s Magazine,” “Canada Monthly,” etc., etc., and gratefully acknowledge
the voluntary kindness of friends who unlocked the storehouses of memory
or cheerfully furnished desired photographs and engravings.</p>

<p>The indulgence of the reader is requested should he observe a discrepancy
affecting the title, employer or location of any individual, resulting from change
or promotion between the time of preparation and publication of these papers.</p>

  <p class="p0">Mayor of Cobourg, 1853.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Sir John Franklin, arctic navigator,
with canoe crews of Indians and
voyageurs, eastbound after exploring
the Great Lakes, pitched wigwams in the summer
of 1839 at the confluence of stream and
lake where the nucleus of present Cobourg,
Canada, was taking root, little did these
adventurous and actual forerunners of easy
steam locomotion think that from a point
where they camped a railroad would thirteen
years later bisect the unbroken forest. Yet,
it is so, and the whirligig of time has, likewise,
seen recorded the obituary of that railway—has
witnessed the effacement of the name of
those early laid metal ribbons from the time
tables of a young country which still hungers
and lobbies for more and more tracks and
trams.</p>

<p>Cobourg and thereabouts, is ancient territory
as settlements go nowadays. In 1796 the
district was surveyed. Eluid Nickerson, who
espoused the United Empire Loyalist cause, took out the first patent in 1802
during the reign of King George III., but in spite of its monarchial predilections,
the locality has long been of interest to our cousins of high and low
degree living south of Lake Ontario, and a few years after the construction of
Cobourg and Peterborough Railway, of which I speak, several iron masters
and capitalists from Pittsburg acquired the property, altering somewhat its
original mission.</p>

<p>The prospectus of this pioneer Canadian line was mooted in 1851 by local
promoters: it took definite form in 1852 and on February 7th, 1853, Lady
Mayoress, Mrs. S. E. MacKechnie, officiated in the ceremony of turning the
first sod amidst tremendous public enthusiasm. As early as 1844 a daily
stage ran in winter from Peterborough to Cobourg and Port Hope, and in
summer the steamboat “Forrester” plied to Harwood and connected with the
stage coaches. Close in the wake of this propitious beginning construction
advanced, while feathered and furry prowlers of the virgin woods had their
curiosity piqued by strange sights and sounds. Under the supervision of
chief engineer Ira Spaulding, contractors Zimmerman and Balch pushed the
line through valley and glade to Rice Lake’s fertile, sloping shores at Harwood
where, later, sawmills sawed the stately pines that arrived in drives
from Otonabee. During the following year Mr. Zimmerman collaborated in
the extension as far as Peterborough, his tragic death in the des Jardins Canal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
disaster at Hamilton, March, 1857, terminating a useful life. Steel rails were
an experimental luxury, iron scarce and expensive and timber often replaced
them. Antique locomotives with impossible superstructures coughed and
squeaked along, meanwhile eating a mighty hole in the wood pile, for coal and
oil burners were not contrived, and what a risk it was to venture between the
oscillating cars. Though crudely equipped, the road was nevertheless, a
startling and welcome innovation for abbreviating space. The Grand Trunk
Railway had not yet been built and the saddle horse and coach were the only
substitutes for pedestrianism. Picture, if you can, a journey inside a two
teamed springless stage, tediously winding westward past bear haunt, swamp
and river; for instance, over the historic, old military road from Kingston.
It must have been a hunter’s paradise.</p>

<p>The bridging of Rice Lake was a large undertaking at the period and
proved a burden from which the management never recovered. This structure
became notorious later for several reasons. From Harwood to Tick Island,
some distance off shore, a filling was made and the bridge trestles were projected
two miles across the westerly loop of the lake to where Hiawatha Indian
settlement still harbors the fishing and rice gathering sons and daughters of
sires long since passed to the happy hunting grounds. You may see them any
summer day vieing with “Alderville” redskins from near Roseneath, in deftly
wielding the paddle, as of yore when their forebears fought fiercely all around
that favored camping place.</p>

<p>In winter of 1857, when the frost and ice heaved the bridge, four-horse
sleighs transported passengers inland between Harwood, the Indian village
and station at Ashburnham, seven miles north. To take charge of this old
depot, which afterwards became a canoe factory, Donald Sutherland was the
first appointed and Mr. Roe Buck became the Cobourg representative. William
Von Ingen, now collector of His Majesty’s Customs levy at Woodstock, Ont.,
collected tickets covering the run of about twenty-five miles which cost $1.00
per capital and entitled one to all privileges save the compartment sleeper and
electric fans, which had not yet been adopted.</p>

<p>It is said that John Fowler, charter corporation member and first manager,
whose regime did not fill the company’s coffers, made towards the close of his
term, a financial <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d’etat</i> with the Midland, Port Perry, Lindsay &amp; Beaverton
Railway. He was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel D’Arcy E. Boulton, a
Cobourg aristocrat who rented the “C. &amp; P.” property in 1857 and battled
valiantly against odds in an endeavor to place the road on a paying basis.
This railway’s legitimate traffic—forest products and lumber—were hauled
for several years from the interior to the docks at Cobourg, thence by schooner
to various lake ports, but time wrought changes and debt became the most
formidable obstacle to progress.</p>

<p class="p0">A distinguished passenger who rode
over the C.P. &amp; M. Ry., 1874.</p></div></div>

<p>It is recounted that one forenoon long ago the sheriff unexpectedly boarded
a northbound “C. &amp; P.” train on which the superintendent was also travelling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Although the latter was not a mind
reader he had a presentment that the
sheriff’s presence might not auger well
for his particular department. Everything
was as placid as the lake itself
until the train approached the height of
land at Summit, nine miles up from
Cobourg, when the brakes controlling
rear car in which the court official sat
in tranquil state, were locked and the
coupling pin withdrawn. A retrograde
movement quickly followed and the
sheriff was powerless to stem the progress
of his unwilling hurry. As though
the evil one was after him, down grade
rolled the flustered occupant of the
flying carriage to where it started.
Nothing daunting, the sheriff procured
a team and drove thirteen miles back
to Harwood, but found on arrival that
everything not nailed down, including
attachable railway equipment, etc.,
had forsaken Northumberland and was
transferred across the bridge to the
next county.</p>

<p>Early in the day of September 7th,
1860, a “special” moved over the “C. &amp;
P.” conveying Edward, Prince of Wales
and suite from Cobourg to Harwood
en route Peterborough. As the old bridge was considered unsafe for this
precious young patron and entourage, they were much interested in being
ferried across Rice Lake to the Mississauga Indian settlement near the mouth
of the winding Otonabee River, from which point the late Robert White,
highly respected for leagues around, enjoyed the honor and privilege of driving
Royalty and his retinue to Peterborough.</p>

<p>After the Civil War the road came into possession of a genial Virgianian,
Colonel William Chambliss and his confreres, Messrs. Schoenburg and Fitzhugh
from the South, with interests in Pennsylvania. Colonel Chambliss
was elected managing director, the title was changed to Cobourg, Peterborough
&amp; Marmora Railway &amp; Mining Company, and its new purpose was hauling
iron ore destined Cleveland from Marmora mines to vessels at Cobourg. This
ore was moved on scows from Blairton to Harwood.</p>

<p>The old Parliament of Upper Canada had incorporated the earlier organization
and in 1869 an Act was passed legalizing the amalgamation of railway and
mining company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>During the summer of 1874 the Vice-Regal couple, Lord and Lady Dufferin,
participated in an eleven hour outing from Cobourg via C.P. &amp; M.R. &amp; M. Co.,
Harwood, Rice Lake steamer and Hastings, and extracts from the Countess’
description of their ore mine inspection and experiences, as set down in Her
Ladyship’s diary at the time, reads as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I did not expect to care the least about it as we had seen so many
untidy, stoney, barren places called mines, but this one was really an
interesting sight. We found ourselves at the top of an enormous hole or
cavern, 140 feet deep, large in proportion, perfectly open and light as
day. The men looked like imps as they worked below and it was the
sort of thing one sees represented, in miniature, in a fairy play. The
sides were walls of iron: but, alas, coal is found only in the States....</p>

<p>“When we returned to the steamer we found a barge tied to its side
covered in with green—a floating arbor—in which lunch was laid: and
very glad we were of it, as we had breakfasted at 7.30 a.m. and it was now
2.00 p.m. The managers of the mines, the steamers, etc., are Americans,
and we were their guests. Colonel Chambliss and General Fitzhugh,
with their wives (two sisters), were our hosts. They lived in the hotel at
which we stayed and are charming Southerners.”</p>
</div>

<p>It would appear that the bridging of Rice Lake was costly, but on account
of engineering difficulties, not permanent. The alternate rigors of winter and
spring reaction upset calculations as well as the bridge’s equilibrium. Those
piles which had no foundation in fact—in the lake bottom, to be more exact—dangled
from the upper work, an encumbrance instead of a support and many
of the bolts disappeared, some claim by design of wrongly disposed persons.
One autumn night, after a southbound train from Peterborough had passed
over, the shivering spans succumbed to a gale and disappeared. To-day they
remain the abode of lunge, bass and other amphibious denizens of the waters.</p>

<p>When the G.T.R. failed to popularize the line to Harwood for excursions,
several rearrangements of the railway’s name and financial status subsequently
occurred. Acts were passed by the Ontario Legislature and in 1887, after the
sale of the Company’s bonds under an order of the Chancery Court the Federal
Parliament incorporated the Cobourg, Blairton &amp; Marmora Railway &amp; Mining
Co. to take over the property. The Municipality of Cobourg became at one
time a guarantor in further reorganization. Presently, operation of the miniature
system ceased altogether and protracted litigation was the precursor of
dissolution. Thus did a budding nation in a constructive age behold a once
famous railway rust into oblivion.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> a vivisectionist, adroit with scalpel and scissors, should dissect and
remove the bone framework from the torso of any man, that man
would collapse, and likewise, did Atlas or Sampson but lift the Grand
Trunk Railway System from out the ballasted roadbed in the Provinces of
Ontario and Quebec and contiguous territory, the extensive and most densely
populated area of Older Canada would immediately become paralyzed and
inert. Mankind in thousands would be without occupations, communication
and the written word from the world outside would cease in three-quarters of
the affected zone: again the over night journey to grist mills would resume,
cattle be herded to market, the fruits of the earth would wither on the vine
and the travelling public—wont to thoughtlessly grumble at imagined discrepancies
in the time table—would submissively fall back on the tri-weekly
stage.</p>

<p>How few of us reflect upon and appreciate the amount of planning and
experiment, figuring and re-adjustment involved in the preparation of a
“Grand Trunk” folder, where a maze of branch line trains that gridiron the
country like a spider’s web, must be dispatched to dovetail with innumerable
main line connections rolling to every point of the compass.</p>

<p>Before the first of her sixty-six birthdays was registered in the family
bible at Headquarters in Old London, the nucleii of the “G.T.R.” were conceived
and the infant projects inaugurated in that expectant era of active
railway promotion which followed George Stephenson’s practical application
of steam for motive power in England in 1815–25–45. Although the earliest
railroads constructed in Quebec did not bear its name, these pioneer highways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
were merged, ere long, into the Grand Trunk
Railway which spread its lengthening
branches in all directions like the gnarled
arms of the famous green bay tree.</p>

<p>The Grand Trunk Railway early became
a definite medium in realizing the New
World ambitions, spurring on hundreds of
young English, Irish and Scotch men. Their
methods of substantial construction and
numerous ideas of system are yet extant
with this great Canadian institution. It
has also been a school of diverse experience
and thorough training for thousands of
graduates who gravitated to newer properties
and to-day play their part in determining
the policy or lubricating the clerical machinery
of railroads in all regions enjoying the
benefits of modern transportation.</p>

<p>On the eve of these happenings and during
the period when the “Right of way” lands
were being purchased under the discriminating
supervision of the late John Bell—first
and life-long General Counsel of the “G.T.R.”—the
voyageur who did not travel by
stage coach over corduroy roadways hewn
out of the wilderness, was confined to desultory
sailings on lake and bay or river. The
daily stage coach, which ran both ways between
Kingston and Toronto at that time,
charged per person, Belleville to Kingston,
Ten shillings; and Belleville to Cobourg,
Twelve Shillings, Six Pence.</p>

<p>Clear to the retentive memory of thousands
of early settlers is that nine days’
wonder, and since enduring boon, synchronizing
in the arrival of the first railway train
of the “G.T.R.” at their peaceful hamlet,
grain elevator or river mouth. That was an
event of superlative importance not fully
understood. Like them, the “Old Reliable”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
was a budding enterprise, she was Ontario’s
Twin Sister growing confident and expanding
step by step, surmounting difficulties, each
depending on the other, until now the great
and comprehensive public utility we know so
well and vitally need, together with her subsidiary
properties, is a far-reaching international
system comprising 8,000 miles of
well equipped railway, embodying an immense
investment. That investment, based
on a long, discerning and steady look into
the future—surely made by optimistic,
adventurous men—began when the Canadas
truly deserved the petite designation of
colonies and the manner in which the expansion
of the Grand Trunk Railway kept
pace with the unfolding of our young nation’s
wonderful possibilities is lucidly outlined
in a meritorious editorial of January
12th, 1918, which the Montreal “Daily Star”
has readily permitted me to reproduce

<p>“Last year the Dominion of Canada
observed its fiftieth birthday. This year
one of the great railway systems of the
Dominion will celebrate its sixty-sixth anniversary.
Both of these are historic events,
proving that this young country is growing up, perhaps not getting on in
years, but at least approaching adolesence.</p>

<p>“The Grand Trunk Railway is practically, if not actually, the pioneer
railroad of Canada. Before its advent there were several small lines, now part
of the Grand Trunk system, but it remained for the Grand Trunk to originate
and carry through the first comprehensive transportation plan for serving the
Canada of the fifties. It was a bold scheme, almost a reckless one, in that
pioneer age, to link up Sarnia, Ont., with Portland, Me., via Toronto and Montreal,
and to do so with a roadbed of such permanence that its standards have
never been appreciably changed since. The railroad builders of those early
days had faith in Canada, a faith that might shame some of those living in a
more modern era.</p>

<p>“As a pioneer road the Grand Trunk is entitled to—even if it has not
always received—the fullest measure of sympathy and encouragement from
the Canadian people. It is impossible to estimate the importance of the part
played by the Grand Trunk in the development of this country when it was
practically the only trunk line carrying goods to the Atlantic seaboard through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
Canada. During its sixty-six years of history it has continued adding to its
system, and to-day when the railroads of the entire continent are laboring
under immense handicaps, congestion, lack of fuel and labor, expense and
scarcity of materials, the “old Grand Trunk” is holding up its end, and winning
praise for its success. That recognition, so far as the people of Canada are
concerned, does not seem to be commensurate with the deserts of the company.</p>

<p>“The Grand Trunk exercises an influence in Eastern Canada more extensive
than is generally realized. The present system includes no less than 125
companies which were originally separate in legal identity. It boasts a double
tracked line practically all the way from Montreal to Chicago. It has been
responsible for some of the greatest public structures in the Dominion, the
Victoria Bridge, the Sarnia Tunnel and others. For more than half a century
it has been closely identified with the growth and business development
of Canada, doing its part without ostentation, but none the less effectively.
Those who invested their money in the enterprise have had to be content with
meagre returns financially, and a large consciousness of public service, if that
was of comfort to them.</p>

<p>“It is well that the Canadian people should not forget the factors that
have helped them along towards nationhood. The sixty-sixth anniversary
of the Grand Trunk should be an occasion for a little thought as to the deserts
of that fine old railroad system, an honorable patriotic corporation that has
been the victim of one-half the railway legislation not only of the Federal
House but of most of the Provinces.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">During</span> that turbulent period
in Britain’s history when
Sir Francis Drake’s buccaneering
exploits had Spain by the
ears and intrepid Champlain was
spying out the boundaries of Bay
of Quinte, there flourished under
the checkered reign of the first
James in bonny Scotland, Herbert
Biggar, and it is a coincidence
that centuries after his descendents
settled on the rim of the bay where
the great explorer had camped. This
Scottish gentleman was Laird of Barbine
and Nethergloly and espoused
Janet Maxwell, Balterson, in the
Parish of Holyrood, who survived,
dying in 1689, and their children
were the ancestors of the subject of
this sketch.</p>

<p>William Hodgins Biggar, called to
the Bar in 1880, twice Mayor of
Belleville, and in 1890 elected M.P.P.
for West Hastings, Ontario, now
director of the Grand Trunk Pacific
Railway, and vice-president and General
Counsel of the Grand Trunk
Railway, was born in September,
1852, at the Carrying Place, an historic
portage where no doubt, Samuel
de Champlain and his Indian allies
carried from Quinte Bay to Lake
Ontario their supplies and canoes.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn, two thirds of
a century ago when older units of the family were sailing westward with equipment
and settlers’ impedimenta enroute their original location near Brantford,
Canada, the voyageurs were frozen in and stalled by winter’s rigors and thus
fate or fortune, unsolicited, determined a new world habitation, giving point to
the proverb, “There is a destiny which shapes our ends rough hew them as we
may”. From here it was that James Lyons Biggar, general merchant, often
journeyed in the interests of East Northumberland to parliament in far off
Quebec before Confederation and this sturdy trader of pioneering days was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
wont to accompany goods shipments from tidewater by wagon, coach and
vessel to their western destination.</p>

<p>“There is luck in odd numbers”, said Rory O’More and as young Biggar was
but one of nine lusty children—all of whom later attained individual prominence—he
was not featured as a favorite. Who can tell to what influence his Celtic
mother from the city of Dublin, whose surname and temperament he inherited,
attributed the success of her son, perchance the good fairies or to the “Luck in
odd numbers”. The acquisition of knowledge was easy for him because he gave
the task his attention and his inclinations developed system in study. His
preliminary education in the village and at Trenton Grammar School, culminated
with the gilt lettered honor of Head Boy at Upper Canada College, Toronto,
and that distinction has since been bestowed on one of his four children,
Winchester, on the eve of his entry to McGill University and gravitation to the
army. The mother of the interesting trio and the curley-headed dictator of
the family, was Miss Marie Louise Ballou of New York.</p>

<p>A cardinal qualification, noticeable in the majority of leaders in Law and Commerce,
is the ability to cast aside the superfluous, bare a proposition and promptly
discern the gist of the matter; this qualification W. H. Biggar possesses, combined
with a clear, well ordered mind and a splendid memory for facts and precedent.
It won him the confidence of the late John Bell of Belleville, former
General Counsel of the Grand Trunk Railway and his legal acumen soon became
exact and expanded by contact with the ripe experiences in railway jurisprudence
of his senior who took the young lawyer into partnership giving him
charge of their civil practice. His penchant for deductions explains his skill as
a billiardist and one time enthusiastic lawn bowler at home and on the greens
at Niagara-on-the-lake, when he was President of the Ontario Bowling Association.
He is decidedly deliberate towards all appeals for his opinion on any
topic, does not make snap decisions and would never be caught in the fix of the
man who jumped at the conclusion of a departing ferry boat and fell into the
harbor.</p>

<p>In the capacity of General Counsel for G.T.R.-G.T.P.R., he has dealt with
many weighty railway corporation matters and affairs of national import and—no
doubt, participated prominently with Sir Wilfrid Laurier and his cabinet
in governmental and financial endorsation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway
past and present.</p>

<p>Not long ago his interpretations of the intentions of certain clauses respecting
the Government’s attitude towards the sale of bonds of the western section of
the N.T.R., were sustained by the Privy Council at London and that body’s
vindication of Mr. Biggar’s insight was equivalent to an immense saving in favor
of the “G.T.R.”</p>

<p>With the strain of business he intersperses a lively participation in golf, always
evinces a keen interest in good sport and when a younger man in Belleville
owned and raced his yacht “Iolanthe” on Lake Ontario and across the bay beside
his birthplace. He was also a bit of an angler and could pink the bull’s eye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
at rifle ranges. Many a time, when a boy, have I seen him galloping past in the
saddle accompanied by (Justice) R. C. Clute, the late U. E. Thompson, then
City Ticket Agent of the G.T.R., Thomas Ritchie, T. S. Carman, publisher of
the “Ontario” and the late Senator Harry Corby. A gentleman of the old
school, Will Biggar was as prompt to perceive the charwoman’s courtesy as he
would be to acknowledge the gracious inclination of the city’s first lady.</p>

<p>Like some men in public life, he is reserved, almost shy of the lime light, but
an interesting companion among his intimates and a favorite with little children
and generally popular, so much so, that he proved a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rara avis</i> in local politics
when he carried the Liberal standard to victory in “Tory” West Hastings in
1890 with the untrumpeted aid of many Conservative friends, it has been said.
He was always a “man’s man” but now gives the Mount Royal and other Clubs
only such a share of his limited leisure as domesticity will permit.</p>

<p class="p0">Wingham’s Veteran Conductor,
Retired.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">How</span> many amongst you wide-a-wake
and well-informed commercial men and
transportation people, who read these
lines, can explain where was and what became
of the Erie &amp; Niagara Railway, Canada.
A gentleman born in 1833 at Lungar, Ireland,
not a great distance from Ballykilbeg,
known as John Quirk, Esq., Wingham, Ont.,
would, if interrogated, inform you that the
railroad referred to originated at Lake Erie’s
shore at Fort Erie, Ont., and terminated at
historical old Niagara-on-the-Lake, where
Lake Ontario’s blue waters lave the sloping
shore.</p>

<p>The nucleus of that highway—now
a “Michigan Central” branch line serving
the fruit belt—was surveyed and laid
with wooden rails by Gilbert McMicken between
1835–1841 and cost 19,000 pounds.
Its motive power was an old grey horse and
traffic crossing from England in ships via
Montreal, around and over the different
rapids and river to Toronto, was transported
by Mr. McMicken and his dapple equine
engine the nine miles from Queenstown, a
grain depot on the Lake Ontario level, to
Chippawa, beside Lake Erie, where it was again entrusted to vessels bound to
the rim of civilization then at Sault Ste. Marie. The passenger fare from
Queenstown to Chippawa was 2s–6d. Gilbert McMicken was a patriarch in
the forwarding business, he also built the first suspension bridge at Queenstown
where a horse ferry plied and there, in 1846, his heir “Ham.” G. McMicken,
later European Traffic Agent of Great Northern Railway, London, England,
set foot on terra firma. Permit me to add here, that the latter’s son, E. G.
McMicken, is General Passenger Agent, Pacific Steamships Company, San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. Quirk would explain also, that he first started railroading on that line
as baggageman in 1867, and in three months’ time accepted a conductorship of
a regular train running between these points. In the absence of the present
Buffalo-Bridgeburg international steam highway, built in 1873–74 by G.T.R.
and G.W.R., jointly, United States traffic crossed from the foot of Main Street,
Buffalo, by boats which old timers will remember as “Florence”, “Grace Dormer”
and “Ivanhoe”. From Niagara-on-the-Lake passengers made the trip
to Toronto in the “Rothsay Castle”, “City of Toronto” &amp;c., &amp;c., forerunners of
the splendid craft which now transport their children and grandchildren on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
business or pleasure bent. William A. Thompson secured the first charter for
Erie &amp; Niagara Railway and the Great Western Railway surrendered their lease
of it in 1870. This road underwent changes in fortune, emerging as a link in
the Canada Southern Railway but to-day survives under the domination of
Michigan Central Railway.</p>

<p>From this embryo period imagine the perspective offered the retentive and
vigorous memory of an eighty-four year young veteran like genial John. He has
seen a lot of Ontario in the making and a host of travelers and transients have seen
him in Great Western and Grand Trunk trains. It has been declared that the travelling
man of other days, with fourteen years’ experience on the rail—devoted
seven years to his business and other seven to waiting for trains at Harrisburg.
From this staid burg Mr. Quirk watched the Wellington, Grey &amp; Bruce Ry.
extend northward while he officiated as conductor over each section when laid
down. Elora and Fergus were reached in July, 1870, Palmerston, 1871, and
Southampton in 1873. They considered themselves fortunate if the trains did
not leave the tracks more than three times a week as the new portion was used
without delay and formality as a means of accomplishing a further leg of the
journey. Prior to that time the tedious and lumbering stage coach was the
only long distance substitute for shank’s mare in reaching a hundred towns and
villages which the Grand Trunk serves to-day, thus aiding a battalion of drummers
in the vital matter of earning a living. John Quirk was long a respected
citizen of Kincardine and covered the run from there to Brantford and Hamilton
for twenty years. He punched the tickets of thousands of travelers using<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the London, Huron &amp; Bruce R’y, who remember his brusque but cheerful
manner and woe betide the luckless bride and bridegroom who happened to
entrust themselves to his care when making the initial trip in double harness.
He never did possess a voice as soft as a sighing zephyr and he was ever an incorrigible
tease.</p>

<p>Our subject was the contemporary of such men as W. R. Callaway, widely
known General Passenger Agent, Soo Line, Minneapolis, when he was agent at
Paisley “in them days”, of Adam Brown, Hamilton’s postmaster, after whom
a “Great Western” locomotive was named, W. K. Muir, W. J. Spicer, John
Labatt and scores of others.</p>

<p>He was in his prime when a dozen United States railways competed vigorously
for the traffic moving via Chicago and St. Paul during Manitoba’s first
boom before the C.P.R.’s entry into Winnipeg in 1885.</p>

<p>“THE NIAGARA FALLS ROUTE”</p></div></div>

<p>Mr. Quirk voluntarily resigned from G.T.R. service in 1905, enjoying the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
respect and favor of the Company’s officials as well as the friendship of the rank

associates by occasional jaunts around about, and he will wager his bonnet,
his best jack-knife and even his boots, any day, that his watch regulates the

<p>C. &amp; N.W.R. Conductor
Cornelius O’Konor, from Oconomawoc,
a dry land pilot,
visited under pressure, a
Chicago departmental store
recently with his wife. In
her dauntless quest for the
elusive bargain she led him
here and marched him there:
into the basement and up the
stairs until fatigue made him
hanker for home. Refusing
her coaxing to make one last
trip to the roof before the
store closed, O’Konor dropped
on a nearby chair while
his wife made the ascent for
a little “burnt onion” dream
of a hat.</p>

<p>Her spouse relaxed, tilted
back his chair, cupped his
“Christie” on his knees and
unexpectedly slept the sleep
of the just conductors. When
Madam O’K—— returned in
the wake of a stream of charitable
departing shoppers and
awakened her lord, she found
in his hat $3.49. Now he
wants her to spend their
vacation there.</p>

UNITED STATES RAILWAY INTERESTS IN CANADA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">John</span> Bull’s eldest daughter, Canada—recently eulogized as his fairest by
the Honorable William H. Taft—is no laggard in recognizing opportunity as
it ebbs and flows in the great, scientific game of trade. Like our wide-awake
neighbor to the south, she inherits from commercial and speculative England
the bartering instinct, and is willing enough to emulate, in a modified way,
cousin Columbia’s obeisances to the goddess of commerce. The goddess, aforesaid,
has been an active dame and most aggressive throughout North America
during the past half century. To further her aims, enthusiastic disciples have
achieved such marvellous feats, especially in railroad construction and transportation
methods, during the period mentioned that comparisons, invidious
or otherwise, are well-nigh compulsory.</p>

<p>The prairie schooner has made a squeaky exit from the drama of locomotion
into museums and the tortuous, blazed trails of the gold seekers of ’49,
minus kinks and humps, are now the routes of many lines with trackage contributing
to an aggregate of 256,547 miles of railway which 2105 roads have
under operation to-day in United States alone. In 1860 the Union possessed
only 30,626 miles of steel.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the fruits of opportunity in the middle and golden west
appeared to the denizens east of the “Missouri” to ripen and require plucking
all at once, and the termination of the Civil War signalled the inauguration
of extravagant railroad ventures. Ambition fired the mind of the restless
native and that big, swelling, polyglot immigration pouring into the “Land of
Liberty,” needed space and breezy fumigation. Afterwards, they had to be
fed and equipped, which, pursuant to the laws of demand and supply, materially
increased consumption. Responding to the goads of progress, the railroads
extended, paralleled and criss-crossed the “other fellow” in the dignified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
scramble for a slice of the melon of prosperity. The slogan was and has ever
been, “More Passengers,” “Increased Tonnage”: import, export, interline and
local business all comprised grist for the mills. About the time mercantile
houses were becoming inoculated with the “commercial traveller” idea, a small
squad of travelling railroad representatives, in open formation, were training
observing optics on prospective traffic. In this, the eastern group of railroads
were slightly in advance of their newer, western connections.</p>

<p>As far back as 1868 New York and New England State railways—the nuclei
of gigantic present day systems—grew interested in international trade and
thrust their tentacles across that imaginary line of demarkation bisecting the
great lakes, into Ontario and Quebec. Mr. E. L. Slaughter entered Canada
forty-eight years ago as representative of the “Erie” and is said to have been
the first foreign line travelling agent to invade British domains on such a mission.
Some Canadian merchants no doubt, remember this Southern gentleman
who occupied an office at the corner of Scott and Wellington Streets, Toronto.
John Strachan, genial and popular, followed him and for many years graced
the position, with Mr. M. McGregor, inscrutable and keen, as right bower.
S. J. Sharp was also an active agent of that system in Ontario. Those were
the days of the “Merchant’s Dispatch,” 1870, the days when John Barr in the
early eighties trod the boards boosting the “Blue Line,” and his understudies,
A. F. Webster, Bob Moodie, Charles Holmes and F. F. Backus, sallied forth
from the corner of Church and Colborne Streets, originally laboring in the same
cause. Afterwards, T. J. Craft, and subsequently S. Hyndman, made predatory
incursions from Detroit for the “Blue Line.” Mr. Craft was once agent
at Galt, Ont., and an organ, the product of his skill, is, I believe, in good order
to-day in a church in that Scottish burg. The distinctive term “dispatch” I
mention, was applied to the earliest systematized methods, operative within
a railway organization, for tracing perishable or timed freight and transporting
it via most direct routes in cars of a uniform dimension, color, etc. Ere long,
“Great Eastern” and “National Dispatch” sprang into existence. Hot on
their heels came the “Hoosac Tunnel Route” and “West Shore” bidding for
favorable consideration through the medium of indefatigable Joseph Hickson.</p>

<p>Not until 1901 did W. A. Wilson, a graduate of that school, and formerly
with the “Fitchburg,” assume control of the “N.Y.C.” merged freight interests.
Louis Drago and Frank C. Foy supervised passenger affairs for the consolidated
lines.</p>

<p>At that period there was more talk in Canada of reciprocity with United
States than there may be again. Uncle Sam’s politicians were wont to shun
the subject, but the interchange of traffic grew apace. Emboldened by their
competitors’ success, the “Lackawanna Road” sent an emissary into Ontario
and they “have stuck,” George Bazzard campaigning for years for that interest
until age caused him to make place for A. Leadley, now at the helm. 1884 saw
the advent of the “Lehigh Valley” and Duncan Cooper. Robert Lewis, then
in his prime, was busy making hay, years before their permanent office was
decided on. He was a practical student of the “Morse” code at Suspension
Bridge in 1855 when the first near-modern structure spanned Niagara River.
Thirty years ago he presented his card in “York” state as representative of the
“Great Western.” Only recently came the “Pennsylvania” with Don McKenzie
as sponsor and succeeded by L. J. Fox and Messrs. Stackpole Plummer, and
Little.</p>

<p class="p1 clear">A large percentage of the public have enjoyed or know of the splendid
passenger equipment and service some of these railways, in conjunction with
Canadian trunk lines, offer to-day between Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto,
Hamilton and Atlantic Seaboard. No doubt the reader who has attained the
age of 45 years could develop a comparative mental picture of his first train
ride, its discomforts, shortcomings and quaint paraphernalia. The demands of
the age and growth of travel account for “the milk in the cocoanut.” Before
the war, the average number of trains crossing the line via Rouse’s Point, N.Y.,
was 134 per month, and in that time they transported 9,627 passengers southward.
At Newport, Vt., 160 trains entering United States yield a monthly
patronage of 6,897 people. Probably you are curious to learn how it is at
Niagara Falls, N.Y. This accessible and world-famous spot, redolent with
much that is historic and tragic, is the magnet which attracts or ushers into
the State of New York 20,000 souls a month and 700 trains of all railroads are
pressed into service to cater to the modern craze to be “on the go.” These
authentic figures do not include pedestrian traffic.</p>

<p>Compare the tonnage of forty years ago, and the leisurely dispatch it was
given, with the daily carloads containing a multifarious assortment of perishable
commodities and staples which now make regular, scheduled runs of 24,
36, and 48 hours between United States points of origin, the docks at Portland,
Boston and New York and distributing centres in Canada. Twelve to fifteen
hundred tons of import merchandise for Ontario destinations per month, apportioned
to each of the half dozen competitive eastern “U.S.” lines, is a conservative
estimate of what is handled. They bring in hardware, silver novelties,
locks and clocks from Connecticut; tools, machinery and electrical supplies
from Massachusetts and New York; cement and coal from Pennsylvania;
early table delicacies from Maryland, and off ocean vessels, English fabrics,
weaves from Scotch and Irish looms, German toys, Parisian frocks and bonnets,
as well as tons of express matter and the theatrical accessories which accompany
the thespians, prestidigitators and slap-stick artists. One of these eastern
lines, with a strong weakness for fruit shipments, transports to the international
bridges during the season, 125 carloads a month of incoming Cuban pineapples,
Costa Rica bananas and Mediterranean lemons. The local and through eastbound
tonnage secured by interested railways receives equal dispatch, exceeds
that average and includes large quantities of apples, cheese, eggs, flour, implements,
lumber, meats and poultry which probably approximate a combined
monthly output of 1,200 carloads. It may be news to some of the uninitiated
to hear that 1,500 carloads of Ontario grown turnips are shipped annually in
the autumn for consumption in the United States. It is not surprising, therefore,
that the big “American” carriers hasten to augment their revenues by
coaxing and nursing this growing trade.</p>

<p>In 1875 the complacent east languidly condescended to heed insistent
whispers concerning Canada’s vast Northwest. The tide of travel was diverging
and began to carry with it in that direction prospectors, homesteaders and
adventurous merchants bent on spying out locations in the prairie El Dorado.
Dependent, of course, they levied on the mills of the east for food, clothing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
implements. About this time Sir Hugh Childers, London, England,
occupied the President’s chair directing the destinies of
the Grand Trunk Railway, and the contemporary Canadian
Pacific Railway official was (Sir) William Van Horne.
Lucius Tuttle, President of Boston &amp; Maine System,
D. McNicoll, Vice-President, and C. E. E. Ussher, Passenger
Traffic Manager, Canadian Pacific Railway, later on in the first
flight and noteworthy examples of what determination and
capacity accomplish, were going through a “course of
sprouts” with Ontario lines which afterwards lost identity.
Robert Kerr, former Passenger Traffic Manager “C.P.R.,”
was “G.F. &amp; P.A.” of the Northern Railway, and in his office
situated at the foot of Spadina Avenue, Toronto, Tom Marshall
and Henry Jago shoved the quill. Mr. Jago recently
relinquished the duties of “G.E.P.A.” West Shore Road at
New York. Henry Bourlier, so long associated with J. D.
Hunter as western representatives of the Allan Line, was in 1874 ticket agent
of G.T.R., in the old depot, and Tommy Jones was City Ticket Agent, Great
Western Railway. Shippers hereabout will remember John Porteous, G.F.A.,
G.T.R., Montreal, Arthur White, G.F.A., Midland Railway, Port Hope, Ont.,
Jim “the penman” Thompson of the C.P.R. and Malcolm Murdock. Then it
was that the star of Geo. B. Reeve and W. E. Davis began to twinkle; likewise,
John W. Loud. All in modest positions at that time, they were fitting themselves
for the exalted places they afterwards honorably filled in shaping the
policy of the “Grand Trunk” and “Trunk Pacific” systems.</p>

<p>The majority of these and other officials had frequent business intercourse
with the various United States railway agents who visited Canada.</p>

<p>In the year 1877 Mr. A. H. Burnham made his initial bow in Ontario
representing Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway. This move was significant,
indicating the expectations of western roads based on the interest Manitoba’s
commercial future had awakened. In July, 1878, the late James M.
Taylor, prior to that time General Freight Agent and Superintendent, St.
Lawrence &amp; Ottawa Railway, had the distinction of establishing at Toronto
the first permanent western line office in Canada. He was appointed General
Canadian Agent of the “St. Paul Road.” Unlike any competitor, that railway
maintained an agency in Ontario without interruption for three decades.
Andrew J. Taylor joined his father in February, 1879, succeeding him several
years ago when the former transferred to Pittsburg. These gentlemen have
ever been regarded as pioneers and charter members of the foreign railway
colony, highly respected by a legion of friends. James M. Taylor, a man of
sterling personal characteristics and business acumen, who appreciated and sustained
a clever hand in a quiet rubber at euchre, chose for headquarters a suite
of rooms within a door of the northeast corner of Front and Scott Streets, then
the hub of mercantile activity in Toronto. A neighbor was Mr. Richard
Arnold, for a long time City Passenger Agent in charge of the “G.T.R.” office
located on the aforesaid corner. Mr. Arnold’s daughters became respectively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the wives of William Wainwright and James
Stephenson, two notable figures of the old
regime. The former died when Fourth Vice-President
of the “G.T.R.” and his erstwhile
confrere, I believe, lived in retirement in England
until death. Mr. Arnold numbered in
his staff the late well-known “Phil.” Slatter; a
junior assistant was Mr. C. E. McPherson,
now A.P.T.M., C.P.R., at Winnipeg, who 35
years ago left “G.T.R.” ranks to travel in New
England for the “Rock Island Road” and J. B.
Tinning. C. W. Graves imbibed from the same
seasoned chief preliminary hints on how to
handle the dear public and look out for the
elusive traveller who was not above licking into
illegibility the date on expired tickets.</p>

<p>Messrs. V. M. Came, W. Barnes and Sam. Beatty soon followed Mr. Burnham
of the St. Paul Road to further the interests of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern
Railway, but were transferred before many moons had silvered the landscape.
The two Jacks, “Morley” and “Winnett” swung into line in 1879 and did good
work in both departments for the “C. &amp; N.W.R.,” opening an office in Toronto
in the old Baldwin Building, I understand, in 1880.</p>

<p>John Morley long ago forsook the excitement of the road. He died at
Winnipeg during the summer of 1908, and interment occurred at Toronto,
where his family is well known. The mantle of these gentlemen fell naturally
on the shoulders of a sturdy Spartan, Burton H. Bennett, cryptic, yet merry,
who jumped into the game with a will and has won an enviable reputation in
the dual position.</p>

<p>The “Burlington Road” was right up on the firing line, looked after by a
gentleman bearing the uncurtailed and historic cognomen, John Quincy Adams
Bean, from “way down east.” After him, in order, appeared Messrs. Badgeley,
Simpson and John A. Yorick. The late Joe Simpson was always happy if his
road secured patronage in regular twos and threes. Not every one knows that
he was for a few hours an unwilling guest of the “Fenian” leader O’Neil in 1866,
and had been with M.K. &amp; T. and T.St.L. &amp; K.C.</p>

<p>Brilliant, well-informed, J. Francis Lee represented the “Rock Island-Albert
Lea” combination, D. J. Peace sought freight for them and Eben MacLeod
was located at Montreal somewhat later for “C.R.I. &amp; P.” Such watchful
competitors as “Great Western Railway,” featured by Messrs. Ridgedale,
Noyes, Storr and Baker, and “Union Pacific Ry.” with Ira P. Griswold in the
van, M. C. Dickson and J. O. Goodsell holding power later, before Geo. Vaux
and J. J. Rose took up their work. Charles A. Florence, an “Illinois Central”
Agent, made Berlin—now Kitchener—his headquarters.</p>

<p>The “All Rail” mediums then available for transporting man and beast
destined California, the Dakotas and Manitoba from Old Ontario, were “Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Trunk,” “Great Western,” “Credit Valley,”
and “Canada Southern,” covering the distance
as far as St. Thomas and Detroit, thence via
“Michigan Central” and Wabash Railroads to
Chicago. Tom Cochrane, R. W. Youngs, Bob
Middleton, J. W. Kearns and G. C. Wilson follow
the footsteps of predecessors and patrol
that neighborhood now. As travel increased
from a dozen or two people to an occasional
weekly carload, and more, the number of
migratory railroaders multiplied. Oldtimers
will recollect some of those big hearted, brainy
hustlers including Sam Seymour of the “Pennsylvania,”
Dave Cavan, formerly of Stratford,
John Laven, off the “Iron Mountain,” representing
“M.C.R.,” Charles Ousterhouse, T.P.A.
N.Y.C. Lines, Geo. B. Wyllie for “L.S. &amp; M.S.”
and later in full charge of “Ill. Cent. Ry.” affairs
in Canada, and the late much lamented J. Nelles
Bastedo, who shipped from Barlow Cumberland’s
service several years ago to travel for
“Santa Fe System.” Joe Rattenbury, who
twenty-five to thirty years back used to stow away at his place in Clinton in one
night as many as 18 of these railroading nomads and cosmopolitans, often repeats
a story the wiseacres will recollect about his brother “Ike” and laconic “Bass.”</p>

<p>The many sided men above enumerated made it their duty to assist with
Customs formalities at the frontier and also assuage the fears of intending
passengers trembling at the prospect of meeting in Chicago that much heralded
and maligned bugaboo the bunco steerer.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that while to-day the railroad companies caution
and forbid passengers riding on the platforms, thirty-five years ago the travelling
public swarmed on that perilous projection, on the steps and quite often
took possession of the car roofs with a nonchalance that would make the cold
chills play peek-a-boo up and down your spine. How many of the lads and
lassies in this year of grace would have the temerity to sally forth, for instance
to the London Fair, decorating the top of a flat car rigged up with benches for
the occasion? Your fathers and mothers did it.</p>

<p>The patronage of the farmer and his brawny sons, who had visions of gang
plows and waving wheat, was an important desideratum in that era. Party
leaders were “some pumpkins” and they puffed and spat over many a fragrant
cheroot while sipping their “ponies” and “bootlegs” in company of expectant
agents.</p>

<p>Charlie McP—— tells a tale of an exodus of the boys over the trail of the
lonesome pine to some silent place near Coboconk where the villagers were to
meet them to consult. To introduce the serious talk of tickets, rates and
routes, some foreign line spokesman suggested a mild libation all hands round.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Agreed! Not to be outdone, his neighbor ordered again something out of the
lamp for the lords and laity: partaken ad libitum, in extenso. Now me! It’s
your turn, and so the hours wore on, your Uncle Dudley Hayrick taking on
his grist at minimum cost, business postponed and county council adjourning
to reconsider the tax rate.</p>

<p class="p1 center">CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME</p>

<p>As the train slowed down at a busy country station a man excitedly put
his head through the open coach window. “A woman in here has fainted,”
he cried, “has anyone got any whiskey? Quick!” A philanthropist reached
within the recesses of his unmentionables and handed a bottle to the enquirer
with an 18 karat thirst. The latter frantically uncorked the flask, put it to
his lips and took a noble pull, “Ah”, he sighed, “that’s better, it always did
upset me to see a woman faint.”</p>

<p>Presently the good blood of Ontario, and some bad stuff, was
rolling westward at the rate of two and three regularly arranged
for trains of nine to thirteen loaded cars each week. The personal effects and
stock of the settler went along too, the owner ensconced occasionally in a tourist
sleeper jolting along at the end of the string, and eager railway companies took
turns in hauling the prize. Excitement ran high. The wires were kept hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
about special or inadequate equipment, conflicting rates and alleged unconstitutional
moves of opposing forces.</p>

<p>It was no uncommon occurrence to convene a meeting in hotel parlor or
little red schoolhouse and there agents present would, in turn, give the agriculturist
samples of terseness or spell-binding eloquence. Imagine the persuasiveness
that was pitted against the farmer’s cautiousness or distrust. Recall,
ye of good memory, if you can, the epigrams, arguments and bon mots
which rolled off the ready tongues of a dozen or more jovial pilgrims from
o’er the border; for instance, M. McNally, representing “St. P.M. &amp; M.R.” a
fowl fiend who could eat poultry five times a day, Charlie O’Connor with the
“Northwestern,” Con. Sheehy, that urbane, silk tiled gentleman sent over by
the “Wabash,” A. C. Stonegrave with eagle eye for “Central Vermont” end
of it, rough and ready Harry Badgeley of “Great Western,” Bill Askin or handsome
Billy McLean of the Beatty Line. They talked corn until their tones
grew husky and they were as fine a coterie of unconventional free lances as ever
probed the intricacies of a railroad timetable. To this day the boys tell of the
adaptability of Harry Badgeley of the “C.G.W.R.,” how he studied pigology, hob-nobbing
for three days with a colony of ruralists whom he landed high and dry
by this artful manoeuvre in spite of keen competition. That was the halcyon
era, the palmy days of Ed. Sullivan, Ed. Riley, Ed. Clancy and Ned Hanlan.</p>

<p>Frank E. Harrison, who is now agent of C.P.R., at Whitby, Ont., will
remember all this as he was about this time Canadian Agent first for the C.B. &amp;
Q.R., and afterwards the C.St.P. &amp; K.C.R.</p>

<p>On “special” party dates passengers were concentrated at junctional points
and afterwards personally conducted to Detroit, Chicago or St. Paul. Mr.
B. Travers, city ticket agent at Paris, still, has informed me that parties of 75
and 100 people were occasionally gathered there, and such a pretentious exodus
was known to earn a serenade by the local brass band at the time of departure.
The sturdy knights of ploughshares and other instruments of peace had to be
and were better mixers than the stall-fed variety of traveller of this day, and
the consciousness that theirs was a common object made easy the upsetting of
social barriers to the music of violin, mouth-organ and jew’s harp. The journey
always ensured incident and good-fellowship, and perhaps, some disappointing
experiences. The records, considerately offered me for perusal, do not include
the name of the escorting agent who, while wrapped in the arms of Morpheus
in a Chicago hotel, suffered the loss of his train’s entire proceeds by the deft
removal of a panel in the door on which his coat was hanging. It was when
escorting a party westward that Will Wyley, with “M.C.R.,” suffocated, and
M. Boesmburgh had a very close call in the burning of the hotel “Newhall”
at Milwaukee.</p>

<p class="clear">Three different gauges, or widths between rails, were accepted as standard
in different parts of Canada and United States at that time, and to permit
interchange of equipment, three rails were sometimes laid. Just before the
adoption of the standard, broad gauge, 4 feet, 8½ inches, became general in
America, a good-sized party bound for the west were delayed at Toronto half
a day awaiting the readjustment of that portion of the “Great Western” to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Hamilton, Ont. In the forenoon one rail over the entire distance, 39 odd
miles, was moved in and spiked down in its new position. This must have
been quite a feat 35 years ago in the absence of those simplifying methods
practiced to-day. John Weatherston, father of Nicholas and Robert of the
same name, supervised the work.</p>

<p>Moving westward over designated routes from Chicago, the canary-colored
coaches were pulled by locomotives with yellow bellied boilers, wheels
painted scarlet and ponderous smokestacks—hummers in the old days—but
antiques in 1918. They bore such names as Antelope, Reindeer, Thistle, &amp;c.,
as well as of prominent people.</p>

<p class="p1 center">BOIL THEM WHEN THEY’RE TOUGH</p>

<p>Picking her way daintily through the grime of the locomotive works, a
young woman visitor viewed the huge operations with visible awe. Turning
to a young man from the office who was shewing her through and pointing,
she asked, “What is that big thing over there?”</p>

<p>“That’s a locomotive boiler”, said the guide.</p>

<p>She puckered her brows.</p>

<p>“And what do they boil locomotives for?” she enquired.</p>

<p>“To make the locomotive tender”, said the young man from the office,
with amazing effrontery.</p>

<p class="sigright"><span class="smcap">Young’s Magazine</span></p>

<p>What a shock it would be to My Lady’s complacency if, on her journey
now, she should find it necessary to raise a sunshade in the coach to protect
her raiment from the rain and snow sifting through the chinks and rifts in the
car. This age is not without some blessings, as Ben Fletcher might have exclaimed.
We are reminded here of a characteristic of Mr. Fletcher, who was
advance agent for “D.G.H. &amp; M.” He had been working up business for an
excursion to Nebraska, which did not “pan out,” one solitary passenger offering
his patronage. The selling agent wired him for instructions and received
reply couched thusly: “By the great horned toad Reginald, chain him to the
seat!”</p>

<p>The “St. P.M. &amp; M.,” at birth “St. Paul &amp; Pacific,” later converted by
astute minds into the “Great Northern Railway,” was the railroad which gave
that big quartette, Messrs. Angus, Smith, Hill and Stephens, a gilt-edged
monopoly of Manitoba emigration and, incidentally, the patronage of dame
fortune. Men and chattels had only shank’s mare as an alternative to this
line northward from St. Paul as far as Fisher’s Landing, a Red River port.
Here, transfer was made to the Kittson Line of steamboats plying to Fort Garry
now Winnipeg, and owned by Norman Kittson, a colleague of J. J. Hill in
some early business ventures. In winter the trip was made by stage travelling
part way over thick ice. Mr. Kittson was one of several successors to Anson
Northrup, the pioneer navigator of the Upper Mississippi River who launched
his first craft there in 1835.</p>

<p>The Great Northern Railway, during the time of the Manitoba boom,
and since, was championed in Canada by “live wires” such as Jack Huckins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
resourceful Ham McMicken, who is acting for the road in Europe at present,
Messrs. Kinsley, Graves, Wurtele, Watkins, Hetherington, Tudor and Brooks.</p>

<p>James M. Taylor, in charge of affairs for “C.M. &amp; St. P.R.,” during those
strenuous days, pulled off the biggest coup of the period I attempt to sketch,
in securing for his line a party which originated at Millbrook, Ont., and is said
to have consisted of or influenced 500 people together with 55 carloads of effects.
Mr. A. Leach, who was ticket agent there then, capably fills that position to-day.</p>

<p>The idea which the “President’s Agreement” made concrete in February,
1900, was ridiculed twenty years before and the system of commissions to
agents for ticket sales being in vogue, competition waxed lively. For obvious
reasons the standards of remuneration did not always remain stationary; fancy
prices and fat drafts swelled many a bank balance.</p>

<p>Although few dismissals and re-engagements by telegraph were bulletined,
the foreign railway man’s berth never was considered as sure as taxes. For
brief periods in those stirring times, the commission paid to agents for each
ticket reading from a point in Eastern Canada to the Pacific Seaboard netted
$11.00 to $15.00. Inside information about methods and means, dormant in
the book shelves of many an agent’s memory, would have made interesting
anecdotes had one gained the favor of men like Tom Ford, T.P.A., G.T.R.,
W. J. Grant, for a time with “Mobile &amp; Ohio” in Canada, Geo. W. Hibbard,
former A.G.P.A., C.P.R., Montreal, unfortunate Alex Drysdale, who lost his
sight and was pensioned by the Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad, and the erudite
M. B. “Garfield” Tooker, the Beau Brummel of many a husting. Heard you
ever of Mr. Tooker’s perceptive olefactory membrane? How he accurately distinguished,
though blindfolded, the odor of a dozen different perfumes in J.
Livingstone’s store in Listowel. Then behold, the unkindest cut of all: some
mischievous scamp thrust an uncorked bottle of skunk oil beneath his nose.</p>

<p>Another scout, robust and in commercial life at Hamilton to-day, who
links the past and present, is D. O. Pease years ago with the Great Western
Railway. Dan Pease is the proud possessor of the long delayed Fenian Raid
medal, and when William Edgar appointed him D.P.A., G.T.R., Montreal, he
evinced during twelve years in that capacity, an enthusiastic interest in military
matters and movement of troops. Conversant with shipping and the French
language, shrewd and sauve, he successively represented the C.M. &amp; St. P.R.
for several years in Quebec in the early days, and relates an incident about a
ticket agent in Prince Edward Island who booked a party of twenty round
trips to California and out of the bountiful commissions purchased for his wife
a fine horse, harness and basket buggy.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of agents, active in transportation matters at
the present time, who took part in and recall the friendly but whirlwind competition
“American” lines indulged in to obtain the lion’s share of business
moving beyond the border. Forty years rest lightly indeed, on them all and
a baker’s dozen chosen at random might well include Edward de la Hooke,
London, dean of the faculty, erect, vigorous and immaculate, who began railroading
in Hamilton in 1864, W. G. Webster, a colt yet and an inveterate wag,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>

Lambkin, Halifax, D. Carruthers, Quebec, John Lyons, Moncton, and J. M.
Riddell, Portland. The names U. E. Thompson, Belleville, John Foy, Toronto,

W. Bunton, Peterborough, W. H. Harper, Chatham, Alex. Notman, Toronto,
Joseph Heffernan, Guelph, Louis Drago, Niagara Falls and John Gray live in
the memory although they have ceased their labors.</p>

<p>Among such as these was and is business and co-operation sought by that
original and persistent advertiser, W. R. Callaway, once station master at
Walkerton, now G.P.A., Soo Line; S. H. Palmer, C.P.A., M.C.R.; Harry W.
Steinhoff, Geo. H. Anthony, Varnie Russell, R. G. McCraw of W.C.R. (the
Soo’s new arm), D. W. Hatch, connected with A.T. &amp; S.F.R.; C. Hartigan,
Rutland Railway, and that big four who so well attended to Northern Pacific
Railway affairs, Messrs. Walter E. Belcher, W. G. Mason, George Dew, Thomas
Henry, and their collaborators, Geo. W. Hardisty, Geo. McCaskey and Geo.
Barnes. Guided by Armand Lalonde, the “B. &amp; M.” scored often. They
could tell you of long drives in good and indifferent weather into the surrounding
country seeking prospective passengers and good locations for the half and
quarter sheet style of advertising so much used then; of hard and fast arrangements
upset in a thrice accompanied by restitution of deposits given to clinch
the deal and of mysterious cheques which seemed to spring from nowhere in
particular when the management forbade their acceptance. They smile when
recounting methods used to test if agents were sticking to tariff. I remember
the case of one stool pigeon who, after obtaining the favor of a ticket at a rate
partially unconfirmed, selling it with intent to a rival organization to be utilized
in trapping the enemy. He made a required affidavit as to purchase price and
the subterfuge, with its charge of irregularity hingeing thereon, had not been
operative an hour before the resourceful agent who sold him the ticket, effectively
turned the tables causing the spotter’s arrest on the grounds “false
pretences,” and that worthy received his liberty under suspended sentence together
with a reprimand.</p>

<p>While these diversified events were finding a niche in history, M. V.
McGinnis and Major E. M. Peel, a lover of horseflesh, were on the war path
for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and their contemporary, W. T. Dockrill,
present T.P.A., C.P.R., was a “big issue” in another direction. A busy man
with a portable railroad in his “carpet-bag” ticket case, he created quite a
furore years ago in the vicinity of Brockville. From November, 1883 to June
1885 he traveled on the “C.P.R.” trains between that city, Ottawa and Smiths
Falls exchanging prepaid orders and ticketing westbound business. In July,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
1885, the C.P.R. was completed to a point beyond
Jackfish and from track-end there, the heroes of the
Battle of Batoche marched across the arm of Lake
Superior before the bridge linking up the western
extension was erected. During the time the different
contracts were completing, the builders released at
intervals, 10,000 laborers and navvies in lots of
fifty, one hundred and two hundred, who traveled
via Carleton Junction to Brockville on orders issued
by the agents appointed after each station had
been established behind the scene of operations.
These exchange orders were seldom fully routed and
Mr. Dockrill thus controlled heavy business which
he, in competition with G.T.R., directed round the horn via ferry and Morristown,
N.Y., thence Utica &amp; Black River Railway, an abbreviated but prolific
“feeder” to “Canada Southern” through St. Thomas and “L.S. &amp; M.S.” by
the way of Buffalo.</p>

<p>In 1881 rumors of consolidation of existing railway systems in Ontario
were bruited about by those “in the know” and the steady, westward extension
of the “C.P.R.” sowed uneasiness where the interests via “Chicago-St. Paul
Route” were cherished. August 11th and 12th, 1882, witnessed the amalgamation
of “Great Western” and “Grand Trunk.” William Edgar then was
“G.P.A.” at Hamilton and Mr. Geo. T. Bell, present Passenger Traffic Manager,
Grand Trunk Railway System, made stenographic hooks and crooks for
him.</p>

<p>November 2nd, 1885, marked an epoch in the annals of the prairie provinces.
Although previously used for transportation of troops, it was the date
when Canadian Pacific Railway equipment first rolled into Winnipeg under a
schedule. The event was fraught with much import to Manitoba and forged
an item of significance in the history of the Dominion. The national character
of Van Horne’s project and the prestige of the sponsors of this great pioneer,
western Canadian line attracted to it the major portion of freight traffic which
had been moving via other channels, and by demanding the privilege of preferential
passenger rates, based on newness, geographical position and inaccessibility,
the patronage of the “Homeseeker” was diverted, practically en masse,
from United States lines which had enjoyed the pickings unmolested for eight
years. This reversal of conditions left not even all the “Dakota” business to
the latter, and with a single exception, the Chicago-St. Paul and allied systems,
one by one, abolished Canadian agencies and withdrew their representatives
from active participation in the chase.</p>

<p>Then it was that General Passenger Agents Carpenter, Charlton, St. John,
Stennett and Barnes, in the seats of the mighty at Chicago and St. Paul, felt
a temporary modification of interest in Canadian passenger affairs. Geo.
Barnes afterwards resigned from the Northern Pacific Ry, entering commercial
life as a piano manufacturer, and, I believe, made a fortune.</p>

<p>These changes, however, did not impair the business
relations then budding between “U.S.” merchants
and Canadian importers, and the railroads
of the neighboring republic realized that it behooved
them to look jealously after their individual share of
lumber, broom corn and cotton goods from the
Southwest, seeds, citrus and deciduous fruits from
California, tinned salmon and shingles from the North
Pacific Coast and consignments of matting, silks,
bamboo, rice, etc., disembarked along Puget Sound.</p>

<p>The man in the street might puzzle over the
price of his breakfast orange if he reflected that some
days 20 carloads of this marmalade fruit now and
then gluts the local markets at Montreal and
Toronto.</p>

<p>A certain percentage of such incoming cars, after
unloading, are returned laden with hides to Milwaukee’s
greatest tannery, clay, cordage, fish, lumber
and sand; pedigreed sheep for Idaho and Oregon ranchmen, hair for San Francisco
plasterers, gums, glass, nuts, salt, and tinplate from Atlantic Coast
wharves; also with ton upon ton of coveted Canadian woodpulp which reappears
as the basis for newspaper headlines.</p>

<p>Historians of railroad progress chronicled continued extension until the
ramifications of the “G.T.R.” and subsidiary properties, gradually gridironed
the Province of Ontario with a network of branches, despite obstacles, not always
anticipated. A most deplorable happening, and severe financial setback,
was the accident which occurred on February 27th, 1889. In the evening of
that date “G.T.R.” eastbound express, No. 55, en route Hamilton in charge
of conductor Dan Revells, crashed through a bridge at St. George, snuffing
out the lives and injuring more than two score passengers. Mr. J. A. Richardson,
widely known as Canadian Passenger Agent, Wabash Railroad, and a veteran
business getter, had, under pressure on the part of friends, left his train
at London. The seat he vacated there was taken by William Wemp, Immigration
Agent of “C.M. &amp; St. P.R.” Poor Wemp was numbered among the
killed. This proved to be the worst Canadian railroad disaster since March
12th, 1857, when sixty people died in the Des Jardins Canal wreck.</p>

<p>From 1891 to 1898 seven lean years spread stagnation and hard times
abroad in the land, discouraging operations of “U.S.” corporations in Canada,
but 1900 beheld a restored confidence pulsating the arteries of trade. British
Columbia felt the stimulus, the optimistic Northwest clamored for improved
transportation facilities, while J. J. Hill surveyed from afar the possibilities
in duplicating portions, at least, of “C.P.R.” Later, his policy got the wedge’s
thin end into “Kootenai” and Vancouver, which quickly resulted in heavier
tonnage prospects from Ontario and Quebec for his trains. Canadian Northern
Railway activity in Manitoba followed by the deal that province’s government
entered into with President Mellen of Northern Pacific Railway, threw open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a previously restricted area giving United States lines to the south larger opportunities
and scope, which compelled their attention once more.</p>

<p>The complexion of things had undergone a change in twenty-five years
and the traffic the returning “American” railroads now seek and appreciate
comprises not only settler’s outfit and pressing needs, but everything from a
car of seaweed to a circus train and the variety runs the gamut of raw and manufactured
products. Your westerner unconsciously imbibes large ideas with
the unpolluted ozone of the boundless prairies. He courts sleep in a metal
bed from Ontario, bathes in a porcelain-lined tub and eats well. If he has them,
he freely parts with his ducats for carloads of biscuits, butter, bacon and eggs;
cheese, flour, canned vegetables, condensed milk, syrups, marmalades and
sweets which come from the east. Recently a train of cars containing John
Barleycorn’s headache provoker flaunted boldly across the horizon heading
due west to the opulent personage who imports his pianos and autos in big
lots regularly. Mark you, more than 200 carloads of “Niagara” grown grapes,
peaches and mixed fruit roll out to the blooming prairie every season over
bridge and ferry and into the tunnel’s insatiable maw at Sarnia.</p>

<p>The substantial growth of Winnipeg, Portage la Prairie, Brandon, Regina,
Calgary, Edmonton and Pacific Coast cities, and the mushroom proclivities
of many a lesser burg, has given a marked impetus to the spirit of competition
in manufacturing and railway circles. In the face of an exaggerated propaganda
about bounding difficulties, and the like, and a strong but diminishing
pro-Canadian sentiment, the men behind the gun annually dispatch and receive
by way of Rouse’s Point, Suspension Bridge, Port Huron, The Sault, etc.,
merchandise worth thousands of dollars which our cousins eagerly solicit,
working for the haul in conjunction with Canadian railway lines. Eight
hundred carloads a year would be, according to some men’s estimate, a modest
shewing, but, after all, conditions considered, it is a tidy, “found” business
in and out of Canada for an individual “U.S.” line to secure or relinquish. I
have known a single railroad’s catch in Ontario to exceed, on several occasions,
three hundred carloads a month, 95 per cent. of this tonnage going to Manitoba
and British Columbia destinations, the fresh fruit receiving exceptional attention
and other commodities making scheduled runs to Winnipeg well within
five days, and to Vancouver in twelve days’ time. It is estimated that via the
various avenues between the two nations, from Coast to Coast, two carloads of
freight a minute pass into the republic to the south as a result of the crusade
of its railroad corporations.</p>

<p>In more than one tight pinch “U.S.” railways have come to the fore,
furnishing an expeditious alternative when shipper and consignee have been
stewing over congested yards, crippled motive power, notorious scarcity of cars,
strike and snow disadvantages which trouble every line sooner or later and
which are not unknown to the men piloting the Canadian railway interests to
success.</p>

<p>Twenty-two foreign railroads, nine operating in the east and central States,
and thirteen western companies, each maintain one to six passenger and commercial
offices in this country. Affairs pertaining thereto are supervised by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Canadian Agents, Division, General and Travelling Agents, Contracting Representatives,
Solicitors, City Canvassers and Counter Clerks. The combined
staff numbers 100 men. With few exceptions, they are natives of the soil;
familiar with local conditions, and are liberal dispensers of a good deal of salary,
rentals, incidental expense monies and sunshine. <a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">A</a>In rounding up traffic the
tactics which obtain include direct solicitation with shipper, consignee and
traveller; the assiduous cultivation of the man who pays the freight or buys
the tickets, and canvass of stationary railway agents, whose judgment often
dictates via what junctions and lines unrouted shipments, and passengers without
pre-arranged itinerary, should be routed. Prompt dispatch and trains
“on time” are cardinal requisites in luring trade and holding a continuance of
favor. The personality and perseverance of the foreign road agent has an
important bearing on results. Changeable climatic conditions divert certain
commodities and influence the warm zone hunter from one channel to another.
Warehouse and track facilities play a part in the scheme of convenience, and
that indefinite quantity, sentiment, colors calculations, though shifty as smoke.
Unsettled claims occasionally rile the temper and switch a lot of business to
the lynx-eyed competitor who watches while he works. Friendly, but contending
factions, lock horns for the haul of a single carload. San Francisco
and Vancouver agents, acting in concert with their confreres at Winnipeg,
Halifax or Hamilton, keep the wires sizzling. Perhaps, some of the “big wigs”
put a finger in the pie, and to score a point, resort to every permissable ruse
save, let us hope, that dishonorable weapon, the bogus telegram.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">A</a> Owing to exigencies of the war, and responding to a law enforced by W. G. McAdoo, Director General
of Railroads, all United States railway agencies have again been withdrawn from Canada.</p>

</div>

<p>Necessity has slowly convinced numerous hesitating shippers and travellers
that the canvass of those United States railroads, looking to Canada for business,
has more behind it than a cloven hoof; that sometimes an extra string
to one’s bow is a really effective precautionary measure.</p>

<p>The pack animal, oxen and primitive implements of the pioneer who pierced
the wilderness and first scratched the surface of the last west, have steadily
given place to the steel ribboned highway and thus, on “easy street” when
compared with his progenitor, the modern colonizer is linking the old with the
new and accomplishing, by successive stages, the development of our pregnant
western heritage.</p>

<p>Nowadays, discriminating tourists, individually or in parties, the banker
speculator, merchant prince in his own car, and commercial man having business
in Europe, at the Pacific Coast or in Manitoba, more and more frequently
requests that the New York or Chicago gateway should figure in their itinerary
to permit enjoyment of the unsurpassed service and scenic environment of those
routes which justly deserve the public’s endorsement.</p>

<p>Trade relations between United States and Canadian railroads systems
constantly grow more intimate and wield an unmistakable influence in the
strengthening of those bonds, commercial and sentimental, which make for the
good of all concerned. This interchange broadens our knowledge of each other
and tends to more completely harmonize the aims and aspirations of the two
nations.</p>

St. Helena, when rebelliously
pacing beside his titled and
devoted aide one gloomy day exclaimed
“Montholon! Montholon! the world has
produced but three great generals—Alexander
the Great, Julius Cæsar
and myself.” What monumental self
esteem. Strategist and tacticial genius
though he proved himself, such plannings
and ambition at that period meant
the circumvention and bloody ruin of his
fellow men and their household gods.
Introducing here the Little Corporal’s
egoism, the chaotic condition of the times
and his campaigns of destruction serve
to emphasize the wonderfully constructive
and scientific achievements so quietly
evolved for man’s benefit by the brain of
another but unwarlike genius, Thomas
Alva Edison. Until Armageddon, his
has been a peaceful era with ploughshares
replacing swords and commerce expanding
unmolested.</p>

<p>To the Land of Evangeline, his Netherlands
forebears are said to have treked with
the United Empire Loyalists in Revolutionary
times. A generation later they left
Nova Scotia and settled in that part of
the Province of Ontario now registered
as the County of Norfolk. Near the
little town of Vienna, close to Lake Erie’s
shore, where I believe relatives still
reside, Thomas Edison’s elder brothers
were born, but not until after 1837, when
Robert Edison transferred his family to
Milan, Ohio, twelve miles from Lake
Erie, did the lad Thomas and his sister first behold the sunshine, the birth of
the former occurring February, 1847.</p>

<p>Evidently his elementary education began in that state, but the fact that
his brother Pitt Edison, managed a street railway at Port Huron, Michigan,
probably accounts for the lad’s presence thereabouts and furnished an incentive
to his precocious, nomadic predilections. Joseph Draper from the County
of Tipperary, ninety-year-old veteran, living in Toronto, recently deceased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
who was in 1855 a giant conductor with the Ontario, Simcoe &amp; Huron Railroad,
(Northern Railway), told me he remembered well how young Thomas Edison
later on sold newspapers between Detroit and Port Huron, on his trains running
through to Sarnia and London. He declared that the embryo merchant was
an active, well behaved and likeable stripling who, even during the chrysalis
stage, nourished a specific bent by carrying with him a portable telegraph
key. During the weary months of the Civil War, 1862–3, he obtained in Detroit
a printing press, old type, with accessories and learning the contents of
war bulletins, etc., from station to station, set up and printed the news and
jokes which he sold along the line under the caption “Grand Trunk Herald.”</p>

<p>Conductor Draper said he was often compelled to reprimand the boy
for tinkering with chemicals and for his untidiness with bottles in that corner
of the baggage car where he kept his stock of magazines and candy. He
intimated also that about this time the young experimentor risked his life in
saving the child of the Grand Trunk Railway Agent at Mount Clemens,
Michigan, from an onrushing train and the grateful father taught him telegraphing.</p>

<p>Living in an atmosphere of daily contact with keys and sounders, he took
to “jerking lightning” like a sailor to the sea, soon becoming proficient.</p>

<p>In 1867 he worked on the wire, covering the “night trick” at Stratford,
Ont., and was also at Park Hill, where the late George B. Reeve, of Grand
Trunk—Southern Pacific prominence, picked up operating. In the autumn
of 1913 when the Stratford, Ont., yard limits were extended and reorganized
to conform to the requirements of the new “Grand Trunk” station, opened in
December of that year, the old eastend ducat, (dovecote-do’ecot), in which
young Edison is said to have served a part of his apprenticeship as an operator,
was torn down to make way for a modern signal tower.</p>

<p>Every railroad telegrapher is said to experience once, sooner or later
during his career, being temporarily petrified with alarm on finding he has
ordered two trains to pass “head on” or from the rear on a single track. Railroad
rumor only is my authority for repeating a report that young Edison
figured in such a collision on paper. The publication “Railways and Other
Ways” quotes an interview given by Mr. Edison at London, Canada, many
years ago in which the great inventor referred to his oversight when a youth
at Stratford in overlooking the delivery to conductor of a train order the
result of which permitted two trains to approach on a single track. Fortunately
the line between Stratford and St. Marys Junction was straight and an
accident may have been averted by quick thinking and rapid action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>In many guises I have heard repeated the story of his original device for
answering his dispatcher’s call though wrapped in the arms of Morpheus for
forty pilfered winks. He was working in Western Ontario and the rule declared
that each operator should keep in touch with the dispatcher every hour
while on duty, write “6” and sign their telegraphic signature of a letter or two.
This meant the next thing to eternal vigilance during the quiet, lonesome
hours of the night. It would appear Edison attached an extra wheel to the
mechanism of the office clock, governing it by an independent spring. Around
the rim of this wheel he cut dots and dashes spelling the stereotyped message
and his code “Sig.”, arranging the wheel’s position so that it made one revolution
each hour at the time agents usually flashed “All well.” From the
clock pinions a series of wire coils connected with a weak solution jar
battery, were rigged and thence passing over the telegraph key joined the
charged main wires leading therefrom. When the clock struck each hour
the supplementary wheel sent the necessary intermittent ticks along the
temporary mediums and were in turn transmitted via the trunk wires to
headquarters. The version given me by another “oldest inhabitant” would
indicate that he had the night watchman trained to turn the wheel hourly
by hand. With such ingenuity did the budding inventor abbreviate his
nocturnal vigils and conductors Mammoth Johnston and silk hat Dick Thorpe
never knew the difference as they whizzed past into the encircling gloom.
This anecdote bears the hall mark of a measure of probability and has been
vouched for by some of Edison’s contemporaries, but the yarn that he once
affixed to the telegraphic office door a contrivance that made it collide with
the nasal organ of a spying superintendent is likely spurious. When working
at Fort Gratiot he introduced without fuss or feathers, an improvement in
relaying messages across the River at Sarnia which reduced the labor involved
by half, evincing in this test an early aversion to ponderous method and high
costs, which has characterized his subsequent experiments and helpful discoveries.</p>

<p>In his commercial wire practice at Detroit his colleagues of other days
remember him as a good press reporter whose handwriting resembled printing
more than a string of Spencerian script. They tell how he tied the Gotham
wiseacres and would be jokers into knots with his deliberateness and speed,
the key and its characters being a part of him, like a Centaur and his horse.
His demeanor was at times friendly and discursive, followed by spells of
dreamy reflection and profound reticence and he would frequently immerse
himself in tinkerings with the sounder and key, adding to and endeavoring
to make them different and more amenable to his advanced ideas. The reel
with a paper ribbon on which a message from the other end was registered by
means of dots and dashes indented thereon, had not then been entirely replaced
by the sound system.</p>

<p>On February 24th, 1868, Mr. Edison arrived in Toronto en route Boston,
and after a brief visit with his former friend John Murray, a well known dispatcher,
afterwards some years at Belleville, started eastward. On this date
a traffic paralyzing three day storm set in and the “G.T.R.” train was snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
stalled, compelling Mr. Edison and several others to return. Expecting
improved weather and resumption of train service, he spent considerable time
about the old depot and men who met him then state that he was a desultory
talker, an inveterate thinker and a chain smoker quite oblivious to the fleeting
hours of the night. The late James Stephenson was superintendent at
Toronto that winter, Henry Bourlier so long and honorably connected with
the Allans, was station agent, W. A. Wilson, erect and active to-day, just
recently retired from the “New York Central,” was the Morse Code operator,
W. C. Nunn—inventor of a railway signal device in 1856—was agent at Belville
and “the admiral,” Mr. Frederick J. Glackmeyer, Ontario Parliamentary
Sergeant-at-Arms, December 27th, 1867 (50 years) 1917, had only two months
before bid adieu to ticket work in the old station where Thomas Edison purchased
his ticket.</p>

<p>On February 27th, he again essayed the sixteen hour journey to Montreal,
and at Boston in 1870 the Duplex System appeared, enabling two operators
to send independent messages over a single wire. Then came his perfection
of the Quadruplex, permitting two people at each end to forward and receive
telegrams simultaneously.</p>

<p>His astounding creative mentality seemed to give birth to successive
world wonders as regularly as the birds nest in springtime and more or less
familiar brain children include the telegraphic button repeater, stock-tickers,
an electric pencil with motor for duplicating, the phonograph and waxen records,
dictaphone and revolutionizing incandescent light, then the mechanism
for taking moving pictures. To-day the speaking cinematographic pictures
or kinetophone, steps confidently out of the laboratories at Orange, N.J., to
mystify yet convince the incredulous and expectant populace.</p>

<p>Some years ago his friend John Murray paid his respects at New York
and was well received by his former acquaintance. Requesting permission
to inspect the interior economy of the “Western Union” telegraph office, Mr.
Edison introduced him by letter to the proper person asking that every attention
be shown him and adding “When Mr. Murray was an operator on the
‘G.T.R.,’ I was a news vendor.”</p>

<p>Thus does this unusual man round out a useful career, his balance an
object lesson to conceited prigs and his wizard-like achievements an incentive
to rising generations.</p>

<span class="subhead">Is the Canadian Pacific Railway Headquarters</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> have one’s activities in office or household likened to the alertness
and foresight of the bee is equivalent to a pronounced compliment.
From time immemorial the beehive has ever been regarded by the
peoples of Occident and Orient as the storehouse and base of the busiest little
folks in the animal kingdom—as the distinctive emblem of concentrated industry,
where laggards do not abound.</p>

<p>In Windsor Street, opposite the fine cathedral of St. Peter, Montreal,
Quebec, stands a spacious stone castle, the handsome, towering Canadian
Pacific Railway hive, and verily, it is alive with endeavor and swarms with
the spirit of enterprise. Inhabited chiefly by king bees—and a few queens—this
host of 2000 flaunt no iron crosses for inefficiency and here drones have
no place.</p>

<p>From the pinnacle position in the steeple, ably filled by a shrewd, democratic
nobleman, down the scale through a labyrinth of departments to the
youngster affixing postage and dreaming of the Vice-Presidency, every official
and employee in that busy headquarters of the greatest transportation corporation
within the world’s ken, plays his part in the drama “making hay
while the sun shines.” Feeling that they are an integral part of a gigantic
organization, they play tick, tack, toe with $153,000,000 in rolling stock and
participate with sincerity in the annual round-up of 30,000,000 tons of freight
that require 95,000 cars of divers shapes to transport, in addition to moving
16,000,000 passengers for $30,000,000 necessitating a string of equipment that
would reach forty miles from Toronto to Hamilton. 2255 locomotives pull
this traffic. When all hands and the cooks on the dining cars are intensely
occupied in harvesting the golden honey, then is the management in clover.</p>

<p>Concealed in the brains of this directorate of specialists, or tableted in
the company’s archives and records, repose secrets pertaining to matters,
methods and men, of crowned heads, governments and undercurrents of commerce,
finance and future intention which, if given publicity, would make the
listener gasp in wonderment and likewise aid him to roll in riches.</p>

<p>Apart from an extensive, intermediate network, (totaling 15,000 miles)
her unbroken chains of trains span an additional 3,600 miles of continent from
the cod banks of the Atlantic to the salmon spawning beds along the Pacific
Ocean, dovetailing there with some of the splendid units of a fleet of a hundred
vessels valued to-day at $65,000,000, which circumvent the seven seas carrying
“Canadian Pacific” prestige, influence, secret service and international
communications between all races and temperatures. There are no fields of
production in any clime on the planet known to civilized man that this dynamo
of energy, trade and travel has not investigated and if, through development
or encouragement, a modicum of reciprocal traffic is extracted or the sweets
of industrial success can be promised, rest assured that exploring bees will
return to the hive with documentary proof or Marconigrams, cable and mails
will herald most recent results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>It is a marvelous modern reality, smacking of the magic of Bagdad caliph
eras, that the Windsor Street cabinet of individually expert cosmopolitans,
with their teeming clusters of resourceful understudies, command a metaphorical
view of the surface of all hemispheres, like a submersible’s captain
seated beside the disk of camera obscura scanning the ocean’s bosom. It is,
however, only with the searchlights of peace, of barter and trade and commercial
expansion, which spell security and comfort for mankind, that the “C.P.R.”
sweeps the horizons, feels the universe’s pulse and keeps in touch through the
medium of the electric spark, with the aspirations of the world’s brown, yellow
and Caucasian children. She underestimates no detail and quietly assumes
any legitimate task of magnitude, transferring one unaccompanied child or
100,000 Orientals by sea and land from non-essential avocations in this place
or that to other environment and back again without mishap, fuss or feathers.</p>

<p>Composed of forty-five acquired, leased or controlled railways, this immense,
corporate body, holding the keys of access to almost any domain and
caucus of the sons of Babel, this syndicate that has the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entree</i> to exclusive
circles and “inside information,” that is rich in agricultural lands and demonstration
farms, in timber and tie reserves, rich in gas rights and petroleum
areas, that controls coal collieries, smelters and hotels and banks much specie
of the realm, has a soul.</p>

<p>In her scattered, flourishing family many are called but few are chosen
to attain the exalted places, which are easily memorized. If her sway is uncongenial
or her pay seems not enough, you may withdraw and the ranks close
up, but for those who remain—and they are 80,000—she offers standards of
remuneration far from the foot of the column. Her pensions department,
with a fund of $900,000 and a yearly contribution of $500,000 to the reserve,
even now protecting 850 former employees, is generous, and I could cite you
instances where employees resuming duty partly convalescent, have been
relieved indefinitely for recovery, under salary. Several others, permanently
incapacitated, have reason to be grateful to the Canadian Pacific Railway for
gratuitous aid and acts of thoughtfulness seldom attributed to big interests.</p>

<p>Official Ottawa, Washington and the Court of St. James do not think it
judicious to lay bare for public perusal at present, what the Canadian Pacific
Railway Company may or may not have accomplished in the realm of finance
and loans, apropos the great international struggle of humanity and democracy.</p>

<p>The fruitfulness of the mission of a transportation company with $1,038,074,983.26
of assets, with a property investment of $538,510,563.24 and annual
gross earnings of $152,389,334.95 must be well-nigh incalculable, especially to
a democratic country—to the last great west, with so vast an area and promising
though veiled future. The Canadian Pacific Railway is heavy with import
and deeply interlaced with the potentialities of our own Canada.</p>

<p class="smaller">Freight Traffic Manager,
Canadian Pacific Railway,
Montreal, Que.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">An</span> Irishman taking home a large
goose after a raffle, stopped at a
hillside inn in Wicklow to procure
refreshment. Laying down the
prize he proceeded to satisfy his thirst
when a suspicious looking individual
seized the fowl and made off with
it. Pat at once gave chase and grasping
the runaway by the neck exclaimed,
“What did you take the bird
fore” “Sure!” said the thief, “an’ I took
it for a lark”. “Did ye”, said Pat, “begorra
then, you’d make a poor judge at
a bird show”.</p>

<p>And by the same token, the man or
maid who would take W. B. Lanigan for
an uncivil, disgruntled misanthrope, who
could not enjoy a lark, would be a decidedly
poor judge of human nature. He
has rubbed shoulders with good and ill
fortune, has contended for thirty-three
years with almost every variety of railroading
obstacle, hewing his way to comparatively
smooth sailing under the
“C.P.R.” flag and the ordeal has not impaired
his optimistic outlook, but finds
him to-day a sociable, approachable and
happy dispositioned man of affairs.</p>

<p>Do not infer from this tribute, however, that the gentleman cannot look
after himself, does not jealously protect his Company’s best interests and is
incapable of administering a merited rebuke, or even a scorching blast, because
he can. An old admirer and personal friend described him to me as a hot-headed
Irishman of fine parts with whom he had had many a good natured
wrangle in his attempts to circumvent the railway’s rates and regulations.</p>

<p>In Three Rivers, Quebec, October 12th, 1861, William B. Lanigan was
born and in due time was educated at St. Josephs College of that city and at
Stanstead University in Old Quebec. Sharbot Lake Junction is a quiet place and
no doubt, was a lonesome spot that night in September, 1884, when he first put
his hand to a man’s task as night operator in the Canadian Pacific Railway
station. Undaunted, he obeyed orders and began the foundation for a future
that led him through practically every phase of freight traffic work from helping
in construction and running a ballast train to shed porter, billing clerk,
telegraph operator and undertaking the “trick” of train dispatcher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>Dundalk knew him as agent for a year and liked him, but the canny
Galtonians got better acquainted during a longer stay. In Galt they were not
averse to sandwiching a little Irish with their Scotch and the ingredients were
mixed with success. Mr. Lanigan was accepted at par as a sterling neighbor,
a good churchman and a valuable municipal asset. He did much to band the
business men together by encouraging and arranging the most pleasant rail
outings for merchants and manufacturers which the city ever participated in.
He took part with several leading citizens in weekly talkfests on various topics,
extending his general knowledge and debating powers and was founder
of the Toadstool Club in the days when Bob Scott, Robert Ferrah, Martin
Todd, the malster, and others gathered with him to receive John Strachan and
Malcolm MacGregor of the “Erie,” John Hunter of Allan Line, Joe Hickson of
N.Y.C. &amp; H.R.R., with Jimmie Duthie and Miles Overend of Dominion Line.</p>

<p>When he was agent at Galt the Canadian Pacific Railway opened their
depot at London, Ont., with a banquet in the new building to commemorate
the event. Officials who had arranged the function requested W. B.
Lanigan to respond to one of the principal toasts. He acquitted himself
so well in his presentation of the subject then and on another occasion at the
Imperial Hotel in Galt, when his name was coupled with the district agricultural
interests, that General Manager David McNicol felt convinced that the
young man could be better used in more important work and he was soon assigned
to the duties of Traveling Freight Agent ensuring gradual advancement
and prominence.</p>

<p>On one occasion during the period that Mr. Lanigan was City Freight
Agent at Toronto, when cautious agents had to figure four different combinations
to obtain the best quotation to British Columbia, the writer, in competition
with “C.P.R.”, submitted a shipper an accurate rate but not the current
minimum weight, which also fluctuated. Mr. Lanigan soon accidentally
stumbled on this error in the course of his day’s rounds and came without
delay, only to myself, about the matter, discussing the inadvertent oversight
in a quiet, most friendly and gentlemanly way and the incident, which could
have been magnified, was heard of no more. This is a sample of one of his
traits of character and training that prompts men to say “He pours oil on the
troubled waters” and smooths the ripples that inevitably arise between his
employers and their host of patrons.</p>

<p>It was George T. Lanigan, a New York Journalist, who some years ago
wrote “The Akoond of Swat is dead—that’s what’s the matter”, which made
him over night one of America’s high salaried, most talked of newspaper men,
and his brother “Billy” has oratorical gifts and is lucid with tongue and pen.
He is an effective and witty after dinner speaker who can be depended on to
drive home facts in a pleasing manner, and in 1900 when the late Phil. Slatter,
City Passenger Agent, Grand Trunk Railway, Toronto, was president of the
Canadian Ticket Agents’ Association, Mr. Lanigan delivered to that organization
at their annual banquet in the Walker House, Toronto, a humorous
and finished address proving that Moses was the first genuine passenger emigration
agent and that the very widely known and popular “C.P.R.” official,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
W. T. Dockrill, was the second because of his marked success in directing
large parties of settlers beyond the Red River.</p>

<p>W. B. Lanigan has not been unmindful of former assistants and several
from Old Ontario, having merited his imprimatur, followed him westward and
are justifying his confidence.</p>

<p>The United States railway world has produced from time to time, and
held up to democratic public approval, scores of men of indomitable will and
working capacity who have wrested recognition and advancement “from the
ground up” to the highest executive honors capital could bestow; for instance,
C. W. Brown, president of the New York Central Lines, who once piled ties
along the C.M. &amp; St. P.R., for a living, or rodmen who now control the great
United States Government affinity, the Pennsylvania System, as well as a few
naturalized “Americans” with Canadian lines, but I do not recall a “native
son”, laboring always with one company, whose record surpasses the many
sided experiences—hard at the time—of the official who has been for ten years
Assistant Freight Traffic Manager at Winnipeg. This golden west gateway
is a strategical point to the wide-a-wake corporation employing W. B.
Lanigan, he measures up to requirements.</p>

<p>As this article goes to press his appointment as Freight Traffic Manager,
Canadian Pacific Railway, Montreal, is announced.</p>

  <div class="caption">The Late <span class="smcap">James Charlton</span>.</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> no period in the world’s history
have those fundamentals of a stable,
social structure—morals, fidelity
and sympathy—been burdened with more
significance to humanity than at present
and in alluding to the strengthening
bonds which link three Anglo-Saxon
nations, it would seem not inopportune
to dwell on the characteristics of a gentleman,
a Briton who was highly endowed
with those basic virtues and who, in
passing, left their indelible impress on
his personal relations and throughout a
long life of active railway experience in
England, Canada and United States.</p>

<p>Born 1832 in Newcastle-on-Tyne, James
Charlton was reared where steam railway
traditions were coined, as George
Stephenson the great inventor originated
there, shops for the manufacture of the
first locomotives were located in Newcastle
and the old town became an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
railway centre. Then was created a new motive for boyhood dreams and
the power and fascination of engines and trains focussed the attention of many
men noted later.</p>

<p>In 1845, when thirteen, young Charlton engaged with the Newcastle &amp;
Carlisle Railway and from that time ideas of serious business and the elements
of a splendid character began to mature and array themselves as convictions.</p>

<p>In twelve years he rose by sheer ability from the threshold to the position
of chief clerk and cashier in a period when meteoric promotions in staid
old England were most uncommon and following the example of Joseph Hickson,
afterwards (Sir Joseph), and W. K. Muir, from the same neighborhood, he
answered in 1852 the call of the west, entering the audit office of the Great
Western Railway of Canada at Hamilton, Ont., during the regime of Messrs.
Brydges, Reynolds and Swinyard. Mathematically alert, his penchant for
details won for him the title of General Auditor and to these duties were soon
added those of the General Passenger and Ticket Agent of the line.</p>

<p>He was extremely particular as to uniform business methods and required
from his staff strict conformity with this rule in the handling of correspondence,
files and care of papers. He would not tolerate litter nor unanswered
communications, but insisted on a prompt or tentative reply to letters and
telegrams the day they were received. If it were not possible to make a definite
reply to a communication the writer was unfailingly informed of the
receipt of his letter which would be given immediate and further attention.
While in Canada, Mr. Charlton made many acquaintances and some intimate
friendships that were not interrupted during the balance of his life.
He unconsciously attracted younger men, compelling their respect and in
commercial circles was classed as one of the young country’s early railway
pioneers.</p>

<p>Responding in 1870 to the insistence of Opportunity, he transferred his
allegiance to the North Missouri Railway as General Passenger Agent, but
only until January 1st, 1871, when he assumed in his fortieth year, the important
position of General Passenger and Ticket Agent of Chicago &amp; Alton
Railway under President Blackstone, at the time that financier and his associates
secured control of the North Missouri Railway. This Railway shortly
after became the St. Louis, Kansas City &amp; Northern Railway, and in the late
80’s was merged into the Wabash System. Mr. Charlton attained a unique
and deserved prominence in his chosen sphere of progressive “American”
railroading, and to these new responsibilities he brought to bear his now well
developed, zealous and forceful business axioms, and an absolute loyalty and
fidelity to the corporation, and in particular, the officers to whom he reported.</p>

<p>He was naturally inclined towards high ideals in life and loved Right,
because it was right. His word was as good as his bond: his YES meant YES
and his NO meant NO, and no person was ever able to twist his answer into
any other meaning and get away with it. His associates in business never
doubted for a single moment any statement he made and relied on his carrying
out his promises and agreement to the letter. Figuratively speaking, he
was a human prototype to the sturdy oak or a solid English bridge, speeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the multitudes safely on their journey, indulgent to the hurricanes of youthful
hastiness and impervious to trivialities.</p>

<p>The first half of a popular expression, “The nineteenth century belonged
to the United States, but the twentieth will be Canada’s,” was acknowledged
after the close of the Civil War and concurrent with the rapid expansion of
American railway facilities, Canada suffered a heavy exodus across the
border of youthful brain and brawn in which Mr. Charlton later played a
part. He was the friend of young men who would take hold and make an
effort in the railroad business and he probably brought from Canada to the
United States, and started on their careers there, a larger number than any
other official engaged in traffic affairs, who found him painstaking in his efforts
to educate them in the right way to handle their work. He was a martinet
regarding that important essential Punctuality and it is said of him that he
was never known to be late one minute beyond the hour appointed for any
meeting or business engagement. Always an early riser, he breakfasted
never later than 6.30 in the morning, sat down precisely to the minute at
12.00 o’clock for luncheon and took his dinner at 6.00 o’clock every evening.</p>

<p>When at headquarters he never missed being the first man in his office,
8.00 to 8.15 a.m., thus anticipating the regular office opening hour, 8.30 a.m.
He invariably left his office at 5.00 p.m. daily, walking the three and a half
mile journey to and from his residence when conditions were favorable. These
unusually methodical habits were the occasion of considerable comment
among other officers and business confreres. Mr. Charlton hated a lie, scorned
misrepresentation of any kind and positively would not permit anyone to
remain in his employ who let liquor secure the upper hand, and whose behaviour
and home life threatened to bring the railway company into disrepute.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of employers and railroad officials, it is known that
he recognized a good man by paying him well and also assisting him to grasp
opportunities for his betterment with other railways and those who worked
under him at one time are now holding official positions on several railroads
throughout the west and in some of the eastern states.</p>

<p>Loyal and fair himself, he deeply appreciated such qualities in others and
rewarded with sympathetic interest and substantial assistance those long
service colleagues who became embarrassed through injury, ill health or
declining years. They were protected by assignment to easier positions: with
the generous sanction of his executive chiefs—obtained by going “to the front”
in person—Mr. Charlton secured additional funds of the Company to tide
over periods of unusual expense incurred by several who, through service
rendered and fidelity to the Company’s interests, he knew merited thoughtful
consideration. I remember being informed of an instance respecting the case
of an old friend, for twenty-five years with Mr. Charlton in the service of the
Chicago &amp; Alton and other railroads, who contracted an admittedly fatal disorder
and who was carried on the pay roll until death, the Company defraying
as well, the cost of medical attention and nurse constantly in attendance for
a period of two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>The Chicago Observer declared in 1896 that the Chicago &amp; Alton Railway
was recognized as one of the most convenient and luxurious of American
railroads, that it was the first to run sleeping cars, to have dining cars, inaugurating
also the first free reclining chair cars and reminded the public to bear
in mind that these paying innovations—quickly imitated—were largely due
to the Company’s indefatigable chief of passenger traffic.</p>

<p>The New York Tribune stated that Mr. Charlton was the ablest and most
widely known General Passenger Agent in America at the time he relinquished
passenger traffic duties to become the first Chairman of the newly
organized Trans-Continental Passenger Association comprised then of probably
fifty transportation lines. For thirteen years, or until death, he discharged
the comprehensive obligations of that position to the satisfaction of
a not always unanimous body of ticket and traffic experts and his excellent
judgment and ability as an arbitrator on vexed questions was often most
essential.</p>

<p>As the lines of this paragraph are being transferred from mind to page
in the rolling train the transparent frozen surface of Hamilton Bay, dotted
with an ice boat and a few skaters, lies a few yards below and stretches away
to beach and bar, with a colony of fishing shanties squatting in the cove not
far from the location of the awful “Des jardins Canal” wreck, March, 1857.
Sixty years ago, over the same surface James Charlton skated and scudded on
an old pair of “double mooleys” with screws in their heels and he enjoyed
this sport ever after. During his life in Chicago he frequently indulged his
fondness for the pastime. Railroading Hamiltonians who praise their bay,
may not recall hearing that the late Samuel R. Callaway, ex-President of the
New York Central Railway when a stenographer—was devoted to rowing on
the same sheet of water, that his brother W. R. Callaway, G.P.A., Soo Line, also
Alex. Hilton, P.T.M., Frisco System and Messrs. J. Horsburgh and John J.
Byrne, prominent officials of the Southern Pacific Railway Coast Lines, were
wont to fish therein.</p>

<p>Although a splendid speaker, very widely known, and possessing also an
extended acquaintance with prominent people, James Charlton never wore
his heart on his sleeve and sincerely wished to avoid publicity. Most of his
leisure was spent with his family, and being a man of letters—in his unusually
large and well selected English library. He was an authority on national,
international and historical matters, wrote for the London Times of early
United States railway building, did some reviewing of books for friendly
editors and appreciated good poetry. Myles Pennington in “Railways and
Other Ways” says that for a time he published portions of Browning’s works
in the Chicago &amp; Alton official railway guide, distributing as many as 10,000
copies of the issue per month until their preparation became too arduous.</p>

<p>In his business relations with others he was the standard of courtesy. Morally
and in every way absolutely clean, this white bearded Nestor of passenger
men was a grand old man. Is it not a gratification, a mental bath and an
inspiration to read of and know about men of this type, particularly in high
places.</p>

<span class="subhead small">Their name is legion, but this is only remotely realized beyond the broad

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Mercury</span> the messenger, fleet and comely herald, renowned in temple
and forum, was a pet of the ancients. Without demur they pedestaled
him as courier of the gods, rival of swift sea birds and desseminator
of tidings from all parts of the world. The ready inclination to laud
dispatch, prevalent in those misty, cob-webbed eras of mythology, survives
after cycles of ages and to-day dwellers on this mundane sphere observe
history repeat itself.</p>

<p>That vital requisite—speedy transportation by land and water for the
beings and news of the universe—dovetails so exactly with the modern spirit
of expansion that the men responsible for mechanism underlying onward movement,
unwittingly compel admiration. They wear the laurel, remaining the
nation’s favorites until the “powers that be” turn thumbs the other way.</p>

<p>In no branch of human endeavor does contention with competitor, for the
plaudits and purse of the public, wax keener than in the realm of railroading
and America is the arena where the fascinating game is embellished with rare
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i>. Achievement is sweet to the ambitious and in this scientific pursuit—the
result of which is constantly subjected to acid test by a discriminating
people—men of brain and brawn strive mightily for humanity’s greater safety,
waging a ceaseless campaign far more productive of good than were the colonization
feats of conquering Roman legions.</p>

<p>After the triumph of Lincoln’s noble purpose and binding of the nation’s
wounds, folks slept in their beds. The great emancipator’s legacy—justice,
forbearance, charity—stirred men profoundly and his appeals for amity revitalized
the myriad dormant avocations of peace, foreshadowing an epoch of unparalleled
activity. During five decades since, there has been work to do in
United States of America and worthy men to do it. Uncle Sam has no commendable
physical qualification if you concede him not two most perceptive
normal optics together with an eye in the back of his head. In nepotism an
unbeliever, with scant indulgence for clannishness and caste, this allegorical
personage suffered all applicants to joust with his stalwart native sons and demonstrate
their fitness to maintain the dignity of labor—the basic agency in
creating his country’s present commercial pre-eminence. Was Solomon wiser?
Behold the 256,547 miles of steel highway under operation in United States in
this year of grace, which encompass the land like the network of veins in your
torso, bringing each remote part into communion with the centres of life.</p>

<p>To the gradual accomplishment of this stupendous undertaking came a
swelling stream of silver, ripening judgment, indomitable patience and a battalion
of optimistic Canadians to “make good measure”.</p>

<p>Down the avenue of years, back as far as 1840, when the movement,
unlike that northward to-day, was almost a stampede south, Canada had been
loaning United States the best of her bone and sinew. Thousands of
determined, capable young men craving new worlds to conquer, burned their
bridges and sought a future midst beckoning possibilities which the Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
held out to the youth of the day. Honestly received and judged, their colleagues
verdict doth attest a high percentage have shared the burden in providing
transportation, that paramount essential in advancing civilization.</p>

<p>Prophetic was Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s forecast “The nineteenth century
belonged to United States but the twentieth will be Canada’s”, when one
reflects that the year 1909 yielded 138,000,000 bushels of grain and beheld
90,966 shrewd Yankees, (Messieurs, your pardon), cross with cash and chattels
to John Bull’s domain to participate in garnering 400,000,000 bushels in 1915
and 200,000,000 bushels in 1917. This exodus is a straw indicating one quarter
from which blows the breeze. Will the outgoing tide float with it the scores
of former Canadians who have, through industry and recognizance of trust,
mortised into every department of railroading in United States? Will these
naturalized, integral units in business and social organizations governed from
Washington, sever the moorings of environment, association, intermarriage,
to return to the land of their birth? Probably not. But who knows: the
answer slumbers in the womb of the future.</p>

<p>What a deal of strenuous argument would have sufficed to coax James J.
Hill, wizard of finance and foresight, from his art, enriched castle, St. Paul,
to the farm near the village of Rockford, Ontario, where in boyhood, he followed
the lowing herd and foraged for squirrels. Occasionally he sought denizens
of the deep along the St. Lawrence or Labrador Coast, and he reached into
fields and factories of the Dominion for tonnage, but the wealth and power he
possessed and wielded so astutely behind the scenes for Great Northern Railway,
et al, were not stumbled on with energies relaxed. His mature opinion
regarding economic conditions and conservation of the country’s natural
resources, was the outgrowth of years of watchfulness and a peculiar bent for
accuracy in conclusion builded primarily on a heritage of worthy foundations.
Like those homespun idols of the people, Presidents Grant, Garfield and McKinley,
he lived close to the soil absorbing bodily vigor and clarity of judgment
amid homely surroundings.</p>

<p>Biographies of such outstanding characters as Jim Hill make inspiring
reading. If this generation’s youthful male population cultivate childhood’s
imitative proclivities they could, with profit, emulate the perseverance of
another young man from the same neighborhood. Foremost amongst those
whose life work in the drama of ever changing railway activities has introduced
them to a theatre for energetic effort in the sunny south, must be listed the
name of W. B. Scott, President at New Orleans of the Texas Lines of the great
Southern Pacific System. Guelph, Canada, with streets named to commemorate
many Scottish cities, proudly boasts that he is her son. His success is
the concrete result of hard work along given lines, and his journey from the
duties of messenger boy in the freight shed of G.W.R.—G.T.R., via the route
of C.P.R., Winnipeg, “Union Pacific” Omaha, Santa Fe at Chillecothe, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
to power and wealth is a fascinating study for younger railway men. He had
been Director of Maintenance of Way &amp; Operation for S.P.R. at Chicago, and
his present most important position, helping to determine the policy of the
vast network which annually transports hundreds of thousands of the world’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
pleasure and health seekers, will give you an idea of the calibre of the man.
He is modest to a degree, never reads what is printed about himself, is thoroughly
inured by long experience, to the “hardships” of a private car and was well
known by the late E. H. Harriman.</p>

<p>Close to Niagara Escarpment, at Hamilton, Ontario, where S. R. Callaway
won his bride, railroading cast its spell broadcast, inoculating many promising
youngsters. Graduates of the “Great Western”, “Hamilton &amp; Northwestern”
and “Northern” schools are scattered from Halifax to San Diego, from Vancouver
to Honduras. James Charlton, first “G.P.A.” of the Great Western
Railway, Canada, was a beacon light in guiding numerous proteges “up and
along”. You may wager none of them imitated the behaviour of young
Keenedge who, when saluted with “Does the train leave at Eleven sharp?”
blandly replied, “Yes, or Eleven slow, if you like!” They all memorized and
hummed the motto “Learn to labor and to wait”. John J. Byrne, from the
same city, present Asst. Passr. Traffic Manager, Santa Fe Coast Lines, took
up the refrain when setting out to contend with life’s odds and handicaps, and
by doing the thing to be done with earnestness and fidelity, he also has compelled
recognition, a distinguished place among his fellows and Mammon’s
silver recompense. Through a similar “course of sprouts” and monotonous
introduction to details passed James Horsburgh Jr., Genl. Passr. Agent, Southern
Pacific Railway. With canny disinclination to “Bid the devil good-day
before meeting him”, he philosophically set the pace in shouldering onerous
duties and accomplished important results with the aid of a large corps of efficient
assistants.</p>

<p>A contemporary of this trio and candidate for the order of merit is Alexander
Hilton, or “Handsome Hilton”, as ladies know him, who also was born
at Hamilton because his mother happened to be staying there at the time.
He was “captured young” and as a junior developed that moral fibre and eager
spirit which buoyed him while climbing the grade to the position of Passenger
Traffic Manager, Frisco Lines.</p>

<p>Robert Somerville, a “C. &amp; A.” Chicago veteran, now President Judson
Company, was a Hamiltonian; likewise Dave Bowes, their General Manager.
So was Harry Jameson, an auburn D.P.A., P.M.R. Harry Parry, indefatigable
Asst. Genl. Passr. Agent, “N.Y.C. Lines”, Buffalo, the Jago Brothers, for years
with the “West Shore” and A. W. Ecclestone, Dist. Passr. Agent, Nickel Plate,
New York, claim the Ambitious City as birthplace. All keep in more than
telepethic communication with friends there.</p>

<p>It is chronicled in the log that the bluff, jovial W. F. Herman, former
“G.P.A.” of “C. &amp; B.” Line, Cleveland, who takes to water like reynard to a
partridge, got a bowing acquaintance with a vessel’s interior economy under
W. K. Domville’s tutelage in the old “G.W.R.” shops at Hamilton. To this
city, every now and then, comes W. L. Stannard, General Agent, C. &amp; N.W.R.,
Detroit, on a brief visit to his respected sire, which stimulates the memory of
other days.</p>

<p>Over the hill via Caledonia and on to the railroading centre St. Thomas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
you hear the homeguard recall with satisfaction the various milestones passed
by James A. Stewart, the son of a “Grand Trunk” railway man here, in his
march from a minor clerkship to the lucrative appointment of General Passenger
Agent, Rock Island Lines, Kansas City. In Kansas City is also J. D.
Dewan of London, freight agent of the fine new union terminal. Efficiency is
vital at this busy southwestern gateway.</p>

<p class="clear">Of such material does the great league of passenger traffic experts consist
and their mission has meant an evolution in train growth unprecedented on
two hemispheres. To attain high-water mark in comfort, speed and elegance,
their eternal vigilance and rivalry has balked at naught that invention could
suggest in devices of steel, electricity, rare, imported woods, marquetry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
costly draperies to adorn and strengthen the wheeled and floating palaces in
which they evince unbounded pride. Youth must have its sway, and because
of the wanderlust in their veins, hundreds of these Northern blades, fortified
with little but a sound mind in a sound body, elementary knowledge well instilled
and an instinctive distrust of luxury’s blandishments, sallied forth to make the
mirage, “Green are hills far away” a pulsating actuality. With none of

<p class="p0 smaller">President, Chicago &amp; Eastern Illinois Railway.</p></div></div>

<p>The operating department
of the railroads
seems to have had a
special attraction for the
capabilities of many
Canadians, which is born
out by the outstanding
examples mentioned in
this partial resume.
Samuel G. Strickland,
General Manager, C. &amp; N.W.R.,
was reared at Lakefield,
Ont., in Kawartha
Lakes locality and it takes
a good man to please the
veteran Marvin Hughitt
who always expected a
high quality of service.</p>

<p>Yet another United
States railroader who was
cradled in Canada is W. J.
Jackson, former Vice-President
of the Chicago &amp;
Eastern Illinois Railway,
and now President and
Receiver of this property
at Chicago, who has recollections
of earlier days
when he was “Johnnie”
Jackson, working on the
“inwards” desk with the “G.T.R.” at Toronto before he went west with the
late George B. Reeve when the latter was traffic manager with the Chicago
&amp; Grand Trunk Railway.</p>

<p>There comes to mind the names of half a dozen operating officers located
at different points of the compass beginning at the “Atlantic” with John
McCraw, Superintendent, Central Vermont Railway, New London, Conn.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
born at Craigvale and well trained in all departments by the Grand Trunk
Railway. He knows the game from billing express, handling the throttle or
shifting a bridge at night, and by his urbanity and quiet effectiveness made a
reputation along the Sound. George Reith, Superintendent Virginian Railway
at Norfolk, Va., who gravitated from unobtrusive Hensall to scenes of greater
scope; John T. Lewis, Superintendent Tennessee Central Railway, Nashville,
Tenn., from Hamilton, who did not “pass the buck” but shouldered his responsibilities;
A. L. Boughner, a son of St. Thomas, now Superintendent of Terminals
for “M.K. &amp; T.” at St. Louis, the road that operates the “Katy Flyer”;
W. H. Jones, formerly with “O.S.L.”, Pocatello, at present Superintendent of
Southern Pacific Ry., Riverside, Cal., and J. D. Brennen from Brockville,
beside the St. Lawrence, Superintendent at Sacramento, for the same extensive
system.</p>

<p>Indexed with Uncle Sam’s adopted sons let us register the names of Arthur
G. Wells, Los Angeles, California, General Manager, Santa Fe Coast Lines,
the son of a Guelph, Ontario, postmaster, whose work in Detroit, Toledo,
Cincinnati, &amp;c., helped him to climb the ladder like a fireman at a fire. Likewise,
his brother, R. E. Wells, a general manager with the San Pedro System,
genial Geo. W. Hibbard, formerly A.G.P.A., C.M. &amp; P.S.R., Seattle, and A. D.
Charlton, A.G.P.A., Northern Pacific Railway, Portland, Oregon. There are
several others who have found a field for congenial labor along the Pacific
Slope where perennial verdancy carpets each beautiful valley and after a business
trip in that region Mr. Geo. T. Bell, P.T.M., G.T.R., told me after returning,
some time ago, that “the woods were full of them”. No doubt, he had
in mind the case of Mr. D. W. Campbell. Born in Hanover, Ont., about 1858,
this village boy moved along step by step from quiet surroundings to a place in
the sun that demands accurate judgment in conserving public safety and
promoting the expectations of capital. Durham was where he learned the difference
between an engine cab and a coupe, how to abstract way bills and also
prime the telegraph battery jars with blue stone. He dispatched trains with
the G.T.R., at Stratford, with the C.P.R. at Moose Jaw, the C.B. &amp; Q.R. at
Dubuque and the N.P.R. at Missoula, Montana, gaining confidence and reputation.
For some time his headquarters was at Tekoa on the “O.R. &amp; N.Co.”
As Superintendent of this line he was transferred to Portland and to Seattle.
Later the Southern Pacific Railway engaged his services for executive duties at
terminals beside Puget Sound, which were the forerunners of assignments in
California, culminating in the berth of Asst. Genl. Manager, Southern Pacific
Ry, Los Angeles, as gazetted in the current issue of Official Guide.</p>

<p>The lustre of that becoming virtue modesty, dims not if blossoming in a
railroader’s physique, but when a prominent man like John Francis, General
Passenger Agent, Burlington Route, side steps a niche in “the hall of fame”,
deprecating the reproduction of his photographed features, and explaining,,
“Twenty years have elapsed since I faced a machine that would stand for such
an operation”, his bashfulness checks “Over” and generates regret. The baptismal
archives at Longueuil, Quebec, record the initial appearance of Mr.
Francis, but he has been “Present” many times since and proven an entertaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
raconteur. Frank F. Barbour, retiring G.P.A., Rutland Railway, was
cradled at Montreal, and east of this former possession of King Louis, at Newport,
in the maritime “finnan haddie” province of Nova Scotia, Eben E. MacLeod
was born. The path he traversed to Chairmanship of Western Passenger
Association led through Eastern Canada and eight different ticket office positions
in various states. Mr. MacLeod courted responsibilities, always received a
square deal under the Stars &amp; Stripes and the end is not yet, as he is in his
prime and looks the part.</p>

<p>The hands of destiny which mold futures, often weave a woof of inscrutable,
unfamiliar design. Had James Webster, the persistent Owen Sound student,
been informed by D. McNicol in olden days when they were together on
“Toronto, Grey &amp; Bruce”, that his horoscope prognosticated “Freight Traffic
Manager” in 1918, “Jimmie” would have scorned the soft impeachment and
played sluggard in swallowing the Scotchman’s capsule. Yet, James Webster,
master of detail, the Nickel Plate graduate whom “N.Y.C.” has exalted,
deserves a bronze in the gallery of immortals to radiate encouragement for the
struggling faithful and confusion to grumblers. Mr. W. A. Terry, Asst. Freight
Traffic Manager, N.Y.C. Lines, Chicago, spent some time in his youth in
Canada. Minus the sustained efforts of these officials, of their passenger
confreres and the gentlemen comprising the solicitation staff identified with
the traffic departments, the railways could boast of gilded coaches and a nickel
rail and then be doomed to failure, notwithstanding the swan songs sung by
some of our operating friends, declared a very prominent traffic officer in the
Northwest.</p>

<p>It is estimated by financiers that $500,000,000 were to be spent in Canada
during 1910 to meet proposed expansion by the Government, great corporations
and railways. Expectations did not bulk so large when W. D. Carrick,
who is Genl. Baggage Agent, St. Paul Road, resigned from the Great Western
Railroad in 1879 to obey Horace Greely’s command. Excepting five years in
“G.W.R.” service, where was laid the foundation of practical knowledge, his
career has been one of continuous devotion to a single company. You will
observe, if you have seen him, that the cares of state make scant impress on
the features of this wholesome looking gentleman who considers riches but the
baggage of fortune.</p>

<p>Mr. Carrick came from Galt, Ont., and the brothers Albert and Thomas
H. MacRae who manage and edit the popular employees magazine of the Santa
Fe Railway also originated there. From prosaic Guelph, where bare-footed
boys duck in the deep holes of the Riverlet Speed, came C. E. Dutton, former
Genl. Agent at Helena, Mont., for Great Northern Railway. Eugene Duval,
Omaha, A.G.W.A., of C.M. &amp; St.P.R., years ago thrived lustily on the ozone
of Quebec and Colonel W. J. Boyle, G.A.P.D., Milwaukee, now and then harks
back to former days in Chatham, where also Charley McPherson and Geo. J.
Ryan—recently Genl. Industrial Commissioner of “Great Northern”, now
with the Soo Line—learned their P’s and Q’s. To this incomplete catalogue
of aspirants to stellar honors who investigate balances, tariffs and interlocking
switches, as bees do the flowers, may be included J. H. Ellis, from Belleville<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
beside the placid “Quinte”, Secretary of “L. &amp; N.”, Louisville, F. W. Main,
Toronto, Auditor “C.R.I. &amp; P.”, Kincardine’s standard bearer, W. Hogarth,
Auditor El Paso &amp; Southwestern, and Charles A. Gormally so capably representing
the “G.T.R.” in the heart of things at Chicago. Affable Alex. Macdougall,
D.P.A., I.C.R., St. Paul, John W. Kearns, D.P.A., P.M.R., Detroit, and C. R.
Graves, C.P.A., Salt Lake Route, Los Angeles, when punching the time limit
at the ticket window in days gone by, may remember the colloquy—“Can you
direct me to the best hotel in this town?” asked an unacquainted railway man
of another as he stepped off a train. “I can brother,” said he going away,
“but I hate to do it.” “Why?” “Because you will think after you have seen
it that I’m a liar”.</p>

<p>The proverb “Economy—easy chair of old age”, expounds a cardinal
requisite in railway construction. Deference to this admonition spelled marked
success financially for Donald and James A. MacIntosh, “Men from Glengarry”,
a team of contractors and graders favorably known to western railroad
builders. Jealous of reputation, by hewing to the line they made good where
others often failed and their forty years of unremitting effort were crowned
by enjoyment of the premium. Speaking over the casket of Donald Alexander
McIntosh in Forest Home Cemetery Chapel, Milwaukee, 1915, the Reverend
James Oastler, D.D., said in part, “These Glengarry men are sons of the men
who had come from the highlands and islands of Scotland in the earlier days—and
mighty men they were—pioneers—builders of empires. Their manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
life bred in them hardiness of frame, alertness of sense, readiness of resource,
and a courage that grew with peril. Fighting was like wine to them, when the
fight was worth while.”</p>

<p>We of the United States, can congratulate ourselves that some of the Glengarry
men found their way across the border, and brought with them their
courage, their resourcefulness, and their love of the open. They did not ask
for an opening. They asked this question: “What does the world need to
have done?” Then they set about doing it. Donald A. McIntosh was a man
from Glengarry.</p>

<p>I very distinctly recall my last visit with him and he convinced me that
there was within him a superb nature, a fine generosity—that physically and
mentally he was afraid of no man.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Stennett was born on a farm beside Lake Simcoe, Ontario, in
1832. When seventeen he settled in Rock Island, Illinois, as a junior with a
druggist, meanwhile gratifying his inclination to browse among books. Later
he was given charge of the production in a department of a chemical manufacturing
company and being an omnivarous reader of publications pertaining to
chemical, medical and surgical knowledge, he undertook the study of medicine,
graduating at the Medical College of Missouri at St. Louis in 1859. With a
partner he commenced practice at Bloomington, Ill., and Miss Clara Hughitt
became his wife there. In 1867 Doctor Stennett retired from practice to
become General Agent, Illinois Central Railway, St. Louis, and six years later
was appointed “G.P.A.” of C. &amp; N.W.R. From 1884–7 he held the position
of Assistant to General Manager, afterwards assuming the duties of Auditor
of Expenditures with the same company and he retained his supervision of
that department for 19 years. While he was General Passenger Agent of C. &amp;
N.W.R., his duties required that he travel a great deal. In his later years he
preferred to remain at home, and during the last twenty-five years of his life,
while working for the C. &amp; N.W.R., he did not take a vacation, nor during
that time did he spend a single night away from his home.</p>

<p>He loved flowers, spent much time in the cultivation of many varieties,
and carried on regular correspondence with friendly horticulturists. Dr.
Stennett was interested in a wide range of subjects and derived much pleasure
from discussions with intimates among railway officials and literary people.</p>

<p>He was a man of determination and died practically in harness, having
left his duties only a few days before his end, and on July 22nd, 1915, the date
of his death, he dressed, bade adieu to his library and conversed with his
family two minutes before his spirit took flight.</p>

<p>So enamored is William R. Callaway, Genl. Passr. Agent, Soo Line, of
the scenery and hunter’s paradise adjacent to his line that he dines with implements
mounted with buckhorn purloined through a coach window by some
friendly sharpshooter. He has ever been a pronounced independent in his
methods, basking in no borrowed brilliancy,
and as an original and persistent
advertiser since the time of his regime as
“D.P.A.”, “C.P.R.”, Toronto, this gentleman
merits his unique reputation. It is
whispered that when “relieving” some
years ago at an Ontario hamlet, one
seductive spring morning “W. R.” quit
angling in the family aquarium, shut up
shop and prepared to separate a few
shiners from a creek close to the depot.
Crawling well out on an overhanging
branch he dropped anchor. Being then
not versed in the gentle art tight rope
balancing, drowsiness or anxiety soon
precipitated a crisis. The would be
Walton turned a couple of neat flip flaps
and straightway “Father William”
fathomed the moisture beneath. The
fat hotelkeeper’s “Inexpressibles”, as
Thackeray terms the garment, was the
only alternative afterwards and the
“G.P.A.” admits the ensemble would have
made a hungry horse turn from his oats.</p>

<p>“If feasting, rise”, saith Opportunity:
“Cities and fields I walk, I knock
unbidden once at every gate.” Forsooth,
the elusive sprite does and sometimes
peers into secluded corners. Besides
being awake at the psychological moment,
a clever quartette who found “Hustle
while you wait” their staunchest prop in
reaching the plums were Herbert A. Jackson,
W. R. Callaway, J. A. Holden and
Geo. O. Somers. Mr. Somers started in
life with none of the helps designated as
luck. No doubt, he thought of ease but worked on through each consecutive
group of wearying exactions. As the architect of his own fortune the progress
of this village boy may be gauged by his former title, traffic manager of
United Fruit Company’s fleet of eighty craft, to which William Mullins, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
London and Toronto, promptly succeeded and to-day directs his corporation’s
developments in Cuba.</p>

<p>Energy unsparingly applied was James A. Holden’s key to the door of
advancement, which once open disclosed the road to preferment growing
smoother and wider. Always in the atmosphere of moguls and shunts when
a stripling, nurtured in routine as biller, telegrapher, superintendent’s clerk,
agent, &amp;c., he found it easy after getting in motion, to push on to St. Louis and
the Frisco Railway, to an executive place with “C.O. &amp; G.R.”, thence Chicago
and the freight traffic managership of Rock Island Lines. Mr. Holden, who
is Vice-President of Kansas City Southern Railroad, but just now busy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
the Director General of Railroads at Washington, intimates that he reached
this goal without cause to complain of the way he has been dealt with. He
was a railroader’s son from Whitby, Canada, and office boy in ’77 on the now
almost forgotten Whitby, Port Perry &amp; Lindsay Railway.</p>

<p>It was the primitive equipment of the pioneer Whitby, Port Perry &amp; Lindsay
Railway, meandering through forest and farm, which hypnotized youthful
John W. Platten, Port Perry, who became afterwards a Vice-President and
influential executive officer of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. Prior to this he
spent some time with the “G.P.A.” and President of the “Erie” at Cleveland,
and had been Treasurer of the deceased Central Bank of Canada, which prepared
and qualified him for the position of President and General Manager of
United States Trust &amp; Mortgage Company. He is also Chairman for the share-holders
of “White Star” common stock and with E. E. Loomis, President
“L.V.R.”, made a special train survey and report regarding the value of the
“Canadian Northern Ry.” a couple of years ago. Mr. Platten has lately been
elected President of the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Northern Railroad. The sponsors of
the “L.V.” traffic artery from Niagara to tidewater, “fancied” three other
Canucks in the persons of John S. Wood, Asst. Genl. Freight Agent, Geo. W.
Hay, General Baggage Agent and N. W. Pringle, A.G.P.A., New York.</p>

<p>Take courage, all ye who falter: retemper the spring in your spine, as hard
work, thrift and a mastery of the duties of the desk next above is Mr. Jarvis’s
recipe for raising one’s status and stipend. The majority—whether Briton,
Frank or Celt—accept this dictum and make obeisance to the inexorable law:
wherefore, the sons of “Our Lady of the Snows” cheerfully caught hold and
lifted with their cousins. Shoulder to shoulder these joint decendents of kindred
mother stock have added to the national wealth by perfecting means for
distributing inland and export trade to the widest possible compass. The
annual interchange of business between United States and the fatherland of
Canadians abroad exceeded $700,000,000, being third to what was transacted
before the war with England and Germany, while their collaboration in multiplying
communications has wrought incalculable gain to international good
will. The natural affinities of the two Anglo Saxon families dominating North
America cement the industrial and social fabric.</p>

<p>This deepening of a common sense of attachment is significant and may yet
wield a portentous influence on world politics and boundaries. The growth in
harmonious intercourse—fostered by the advent into United States prior to
1900 of one in every six persons born in Canada—has derived stimulus from the
dependable characteristics of those who have, in the sifting, come within the arc
of the limelight. These resolute knights of throttle, lever and key—ex-Canadians
of stamina and discernment in railroad building, operation, traffic and
finance—rank high as participators in the safeguarding of large and complicated
interests. They are in sympathy with the enterprising and restless spirit of
their “American” confreres and both seek to wrest the Caduceus, or golden
wand of commerce, from Jupiter’s son and hasten forward with development’s
message to silent, virgin places and to peoples beyond the seas.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> gentleman whose features are reproduced on this page possessed
that jewel beyond price. Despite vicissitudes in boyhood and
stubborn perplexities later, it was his wont to always maintain a kindly,
unruffled exterior which seemed to spring from the centre of his being, reflecting
an equable temperament and much self-mastery. With this invaluable
asset, and other sterling qualifications of mind and method, Samuel Rodger
Callaway quietly and steadily spiraled through adverse currents to an altitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
in the science of railroading, surmounted by the golden legend, “Eighty thousand
a year.” In his brief span he attained an eminence in the commercial
firmament which most men cease not to dream of, but seldom realize.</p>

<p>Born of English-Scotch stock at Toronto, Canada, December 24th, 1850,
the loss of his father summoned him to toil’s daily round early in life. As the
champion and counsellor of his mother he was thrust into the arena at the age
of thirteen, when he entered the Grand Trunk service under the eye of the late
Sir Joseph Hickson, who soon observed his precocious self-control, prudence
and business aptitude even at that chrysalis stage.</p>

<p>A four year novitiate beside Superintendent Gilman Cheney, of the Canadian
Express Company, was followed by twelve months clerking for William
Wallace, Superintendent of the Great Western, Hamilton. His chief recreation
then was reading, and mild indulgence in the aquatic pleasures which
Burlington Bay permitted.</p>

<p>A secretaryship to W. K. Muir fell to him in 1870, when both joined the
fettered D. &amp; M., Detroit, marking young Callaway’s assumption of important
responsibilities.</p>

<p>He gave full value for his remuneration, working without friction, like a
noiseless machine, and shamed slovens by close application and attention to
the smallest commissions, manifesting such executive ability and economy as
operating man with the Detroit &amp; Bay City Railway, 1878, that the increasing
traffic greatly enhanced the railroad’s value.</p>

<p>At his thirty-fourth milestone, this popular, but strict disciplinarian, began
in 1884, for Charles F. Adams, three years of arduous duties as Vice-President
and General Manager, Union Pacific Railway, Omaha, directing reconstruction
work of magnitude with force and decision. That tells its own
story. Can the reader recall a parallel? It was said of him that he knew
almost every man in his employ, but he was not aware of how his unfailing
courtesy, freedom from ostentation and justice to all inspired personal loyalty.</p>

<p>Always seeking knowledge, he travelled upward, serving three Canadian
and nine U.S.A. corporations with an intellectual, sympathetic and expansive
grasp of things which pleased magnates and earned his subordinates’ attachment.</p>

<p>He broad-gauged the Toledo, St. Louis &amp; Kansas City Railway, 1887 to
1894, and by going to W. K. Vanderbilt and the Presidency of the Nickel Plate
in 1895, a prophecy made years ago was fulfilled. When he married Miss
Jane Ecclestone, at Hamilton, June 7th, 1875, Mr. C. C. Trowbridge, his
staunch friend, gave him the following letter addressed to W. H. Vanderbilt:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I take the liberty of giving this sealed letter to Mr. S. R. Callaway,
who has been superintendent of the Detroit &amp; Milwaukee during my
receivership of two years. He does not know its contents. My object
is to give him the honor of your acquaintance, but, more particularly, to
have you know him. I regard him as one of the most promising railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
men of the West. He has been in the business from early boyhood on
the Grand Trunk, Great Western and D. &amp; M., understands telegraphy,
and is familiar with the duties of the different departments. With great
purity and gentleness of character, he combines a quiet force and decision
which has commanded the esteem and respect of railway men, and his
knowledge of detail and love of system, give him great influence with his
subordinates, who are ardently attached to him. Perhaps, in the future,
when some of your faithful ones drop out, you may want Callaway. I
have no motive in taking this liberty but the desire to certify to the worth
of a man whose modesty would prevent him from pushing himself into
notice, and I feel sure that you will pardon me.”</p>
</div>

<p>From his patrons and confreres in United States who are said to recognize
and place merit before favoritism, honors came fast to this somewhat reticent,
easy mannered gentleman with one passion—music and grand opera—which
he delighted to indulge at the “Metropolitan” and by playing arias on a magnificent
aeolian erected in his home.</p>

<p>Invited to New York to exercise his wisdom in directing the destinies of
the L.S. &amp; M.S., and the retirement of Senator Chauncey Depew a few months
later signalled the elevation of Mr. Callaway to the Presidency of the N.Y.C.
&amp; H.R.R., and affiliated properties, March 30th, 1898, the acknowledged
master of one of the greatest business enterprises of the century.</p>

<p>A New York newspaper, commenting on that appointment, said, “It has
long been ‘President Callaway’, as he was born Christmas Eve, 1850, and since
youth has been a Santa Claus offering to the railways.”</p>

<p>It is related that when William K. Vanderbilt urged Mr. Callaway to
accept the Presidency of the American Locomotive Company, because his
corporation could not meet the princely salary mentioned in the new contract,
the interesting rumor spread so rapidly that it appeared in the press before the
new executive had opportunity to acquaint his family how he had become a
business man with prospects that would keep the wolf so far from the door
that he dare not venture this side of the next concession. The newspaper
references came to the notice of his son, a boyish wag at college, who immediately
wrote home saying, “Dear Father—I see by yesterday’s paper that you were
forced to get another job owing to the extravagance of your family. I want
to congratulate you on your great success, for, judging from what the notices
say, you have struck an ‘oily’ position.”</p>

<p>Samuel Callaway had spent thirty years of active life time in the railway’s
service and was considered a perfect type of the administrative American railroading
man through inclination and training from boyhood, conquering difficulties
and contending with stern realities without seeking publicity. He did
not like to talk, but he knew well how to meet the world and writing of him
after his decease, biographers said his business manners were flawless.</p>

<p>When he first went to New York as President of the New York Central
Lines there were some who thought a chill had come over the President’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
office, so long kept beaming—as one writer put it—by the geniality of Senator
Depew. The cool reserve of the new President was at first misunderstood,
but those who had business with him soon realized that on business matters he
was one of the most approachable of men. During office hours he was never
diverted from close attention to the company’s affairs.</p>

<p>As a thinker who saw clearly for the financial colleagues of a dozen corporations;
as a man of the world discussing big projects in exclusive clubs of
the metropolis, his extraordinary judgment was emphasized, but the simplicity
of his quieter side, his love of little ones and thought for kith and kin in his
native land, were likewise noticeable.</p>

<p>He counted much on the success of his children and was devoted to his
family, but was not vouchsafed the anticipated pleasure of their society in
later years when his duties would have been less arduous.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty-four, the zenith of capability and ripened opinion, after
completing three years as first President of the American Locomotive Company,
his mighty brain ceased to originate and execute. To his memory earnest
and widespread tribute was paid.</p>

<p>His career was a homily to men pessimistic regarding life’s outlook, who
capitulate to cynicism. The example he set cannot soon be forgotten, nor
should study of the character and purpose of S. R. Callaway be disregarded by
the youth of this generation.</p>

<span class="subhead small">An Organizing Genius</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> the banks of the winding Avon the boy Shakespeare went
forth and his genius revitalized and gave a tremendous impetus
to literature and the drama. Were you aware that Stratford
in the new world long after produced a son, in youth Tom Jarvis,
who is undoubtedly leaving his impress on the peaceful pursuit of international
trade. Contend if you will, that it is a far cry to the hedge rows
of merrie England for a parallel, for a coincidence; yet there is a modicum
of truth in most generalizations. The elect all sing small in the beginnings.

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Thomas N. Jarvis</span>,</p>

<p class="p0 smaller">Vice-President, Lehigh Valley Railroad,
New York.</p></div></div>

<p>A sprig off the geneological tree which inspired the name of a Toronto
residential thoroughfare, T. N. Jarvis was born and reared in Stratford,
Ont., and at sixteen essayed the study of legal tomes. This was dry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
unremunerative occupation and about 1870
he exchanged Blackstone for the freight
classification, billing desk and, to him,
the less monotonous, more congenial railway
atmosphere. He proved to be anything
but “A square peg in a round hole”
and earnest endeavor earned rapid promotions
to Paris, Black Rock, Buffalo
and Cleveland. At the expiry of seven
years he entered the service of the
International Fast Freight Line; a twelve
month later the Blue Line and in 1880
to the Commercial Express Line. It is
related that about this time he visited
Cleveland to acquaint a certain high executive
official of his contemplated resignation
to assume other duties. Suspecting
the nature of his errand, every resource of
his patron’s diplomacy and palatial home
were enlisted to successfully smother the
avowal. Disappointed at the outcome,
the ambitious Jarvis returned to headquarters
to find that a cheque of fair proportions
had preceded him as a retainer.</p>

<p>On completion of the “Nickel Plate”
in 1883 he organized the Traders’ Dispatch
and as manager was the youngest
in his class, with a pronounced penchant
for ensnaring traffic netting good revenues. The Lehigh Valley Railroad
Company had been scrutinizing the trek of the tall, rangy and genial
bachelor, Tom Jarvis—with a host of ‘pay streak’ friends from Frisco to Fundy
Bay—and they soon made it “worth his while.” In ’98, as their General
Eastern Agent at New York, his traveling men garnered cheese, coal, milk,
live stock and passenger traffic <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i>. Circularized again and again,
he subsequently made his bow as Assistant General Traffic Manager, Freight
Traffic Manager, and in March, 1906, Vice-President.</p>

<p>He modestly attributes it all to hard work and the aim to become familiar
with the duties of “the men higher up.” Boys, note that. Cosmopolitan
habitues of the Lotus Club, for instance, and friends in Ontario watch his
progress with pride and await news of further honors. Now and then they
have opportunity to inspect him at close range as guests in his private car.</p>

<p>While the methods of Mr. Jarvis in business are incisive, crisp and convincing,
and devoid of much flowery phraseology, he possesses the most
approachable and kindly personality, which unconsciously wins the homage of
porter and President’s esteem.</p>

<p class="drop-cap a"><span class="smcap1">“A pale</span> faced fanatic” Geo. J.
Charlton never was and never
will be—so his friends declare.
The metamorphosis would too grievously
trouble him in spirit and torture his avoirdupois.
Glance again at the features and
physical contour of the Passenger Traffic
Manager of “Chicago &amp; Alton,” the cap
sheaf to a cluster of four sister transportation
corporations, and contradict me,
ye phrenological bump feelers, if the X
rays do not locate there a large, sympathetic
heart, optimism profound, great capacity
for work and the ability to enjoy
and “Spend money like a sailor.”</p>

<p>Ever since the time his education began
in the private and public schools of his
birthplace, Hamilton, Canada, where in
boyhood he “Snapped the whip” and
operated in the moonlit melon patch,
George Charlton has been in the centre of
the doings. His must have been the
hypnotic eye, or he carried one of those
heavily charged horse shoe magnets, for
the boys and girls all liked him and
gravitated in his direction without know-why.
How many of his classmates have
since made the same good use of their time, think you.</p>

<p>His father was a railroader of international repute, and nurtured in an
atmosphere of “ticket affairs,” it was not unnatural the boy’s name should
first appear on a railway pay roll in 1875 as messenger in the general passenger
department of Chicago &amp; Alton Road.</p>

<p>Thus began the zig zag but successful ascent of Mount Obstacle, covering
a span of forty-three years. He was cast out of the right kind of metal and did
not falter at the prospect or prove a time server when acting the role of junior,
conductor’s clerk, ticket stock recorder, passenger sales accountant and rate
expert.</p>

<p>Invariably devoting the best that was in him to his work, he soon realized
that the position of understudy conscientiously performed, was a wise and
diplomatic plan of action leading to unexpected possibilities. On March
14th, 1885, Mr. Charlton came within the arc of the limelight as Assistant
General Passenger Agent of the “Alton.” January 1st, 1900, witnessed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
accomplish the next logical move in advancing to the position of General
Passenger Agent, and during a seven years tenure his jurisdiction was extended
to the Toledo, St. Louis &amp; Western Railway, styled the Clover Leaf Route.
During December, 1909, the Corporation’s President gave him the right to
have emblazoned on his business cards the title he bears to-day.</p>

<p>While this panorama of promotions glides without hindrance across the
page to the reader’s brain, he can only imagine but should not overlook the
monotonous toil, concentration of purpose and rebuffs smiled down behind
the scenes by our subject long before a recital in this form was possible.</p>

<p>The best opportunity to truly sound the depth of a man’s character is
to work with and beside him. As you may surmise, George Charlton’s manner
of speech and demeanor towards his staff of employees is not rapid, cold and
repellant, but a reflection of the desire pulsating within him to interchange
enthusiasm, co-operation and loyalty with others, measure for measure. Woe
betide the luckless mortal, however, who rouses his ire by flagrantly violating
these commandments. This gentleman of tremendous energy and democratic
inclinations, always finds time to fraternize with his men, meeting them as
equals and apparently enjoying their society as much as they appreciate his.</p>

<p>Kindliness and generosity are his cardinal virtues. They have won for
him the affection and compel the highest possible respect of his confreres and
those characteristics, coupled with recognized ability, loom large when one
attempts an inventory of the causes underlying his success.</p>

<p>The far reaching effect of the recent order issued by Mr. W. G. McAdoo,
Director General of Railroads in United States, necessitating the release of
many employees of the “Alton” who had been loyal members of Mr. Charlton’s
railway family, distressed him keenly and quickened his broad sympathies.
He immediately became “a welcome pest” to his influential friends, through
unremitting efforts to assist his reluctantly departing staff to other suitable
employment.</p>

<p>George Charlton is a votary of Comus, the ancient and rotund god of
Merriment and that mythological personage ranks next to his patron saints.
He is a well known society and club member, identified with at least a dozen
organizations including the Hoos Hoos, Elks, Yacht Club, South Shore Country
Club, Union League, Chicago, Green Room Club and Lambs Club, New York;
also Hamilton Old Boys’ Association.</p>

<p>He is immensely popular with the traveling public and “man in the street”
and they, having in mind the Passenger Traffic Manager of that triangular
route linking Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City, agree that the wise man was
right when he said “A merry heart doeth good like medicine.”</p>

<h2 class="newpage" id="ANDREW_J_TAYLOR">ANDREW J. TAYLOR<br />
<span class="subhead small">Lines to the memory of a good friend and business associate</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">If</span> inscrutable destiny or the influence of circumstance had not planned for
Andrew J. Taylor the career of a widely known railway man, it may be stated
without relying on too elastic imagination that he could have qualified to
an advance degree as a beloved Presbyteriann “dominie” or Catholic priest.
His admirable character attracted unusual and unsolicited confidences, to
human anxieties his sound sympathetic counsel applied the encouragement
and comfort of a confessor and he was never without a loose shilling for the
needy. Coupled with these attributes he possessed a moral and superior mental
fabric and when you learn that his forebears came from a canny nook in Scotland
it will explain and account for his quiet appreciation of honor and duty.</p>

<p>Lesmahagow or Abbey Green, on the River Nethan, Lanarkshire, was
the birthplace of his father, James Mitchell Taylor, who brought his ruddy
cheeked bride from the English-speaking settlement of L’Original to Ottawa.
Her father succumbed to wounds received in the battle of the Wind Mill and
both her military grandfathers were killed in the battle of Waterloo. In
Bytown the subject of this sketch was born June 24th, 1858, and spent his
childhood with four brothers and four sisters, securing his education in the
private schools which predominated in those days and in the world of experience
and travel.</p>

<p>As a boy he caused his mother more trouble than any of her other sons
owing to the fact that he was always “Fighting the other fellows’ battles”,
could not condone bullying and was the staunch friend and champion of a deaf
and dumb playmate whom children chased and tantalized. He was fond of
animals and during his life in Ottawa, mill slabs and water were delivered in
the neighborhood of the river and often the horses drawing these necessities
were neglected and ill treated. Invariable his gorge would rise at such treatment
and he waded in causing no end of trouble.</p>

<p>As a boy Andy Taylor playing a hymn on the organ, selling ribbon over
the counter in Elliott &amp; Hamilton’s Ottawa store, or juggling with rolls of carpet
in McIlwraith &amp; Egan’s at Hamilton, would seem to those who knew him later,
as an uncongenial occupation for the putter of the heavy shot and athletic
participator in Caledonian games, but such was the case with him, and many
another youth did likewise in their experimental quest for the right thing amid
a variety of business pursuits.</p>

<p>When his father resigned the position of General Freight Agent of the
St. Lawrence &amp; Ottawa Railway he assumed charge of the passenger interests
of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway, and came to Toronto to represent
that company—until his transfer to Pittsburg, creating in 1878 the permanent
agency which was withdrawn only last December. A. J. Taylor
entered his father’s employ as a clerk at Toronto in the spring of 1879, covered
the territory as traveling passenger agent under his direction, succeeded him,
became “C.F. &amp; P.A.”, in 1900, and as a respected and trustworthy officer his
name remained on that company’s pay roll continuously for thirty-six years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>Although his agreeable disposition and the nature of his duties in early
manhood, secured him throughout Ontario and Quebec an extensive acquaintance
with which he was <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">persona grata</i>, Mr. Taylor did not eagerly seek new
companionship and he clearly recognized the line of demarkation existing between
personal and business friends. However, many men whom he met
through the medium of commercial connections, soon became more intimate
and it was only a “casual” or extra-sensitive person that misinterpreted a certain
aloofness or transient preoccupation which some thought he appeared to
sometimes display.</p>

<p>Prior to 1885, the year when the Canadian Pacific Railway threw open a
new gateway to Winnipeg, Andy Taylor was one of a lively United States railroading
coterie who sought a share of that growing and intensely competitive
passenger business then moving only via St. Paul to the Dakotas and Canadian
Northwest. He proved his worth, building a reputation which sustained him
long after, thus gaining for his employers a percentage of traffic based on good-will
towards “Andy” which the road would have otherwise been denied.</p>

<p>More or less dogmatic, and always deliberate, in argument he was convincing
and his personal prestige and lucid exposition of routes, rates and
accommodation ensured regular renewal of patronage from individual travelers
and professional ticketing agents from Halifax to the Detroit River. When
he was in his prime—genial, popular and as strong as a gladiator—he participated
in many exciting episodes of personal character and incidents arising
out of the unsettled conditions governing travel, ticket scalping, rate cutting
and commissions on sales. He described to me how, on one occasion the
“Wabash”, “C.B. &amp; Q.R.”, “C. &amp; N.W.R.” and “C.R.I. &amp; P.” made an agreement
lasting for a limited period, whereby they pooled their entire passenger
business ticketed through Chicago, Omaha and westward, each receiving an equal
monthly division irrespective of the percentage handled individually. While this
understanding was extant his employers, the “C.M. &amp; St. P.R.”, opened their
line from Chicago to Council Bluffs, Nebraska, and requested admission to the
charmed circle. The quartette black-balled the new candidate and he, through
the medium of increased commissions broke the cabal and the status quo shot
as high as a captive balloon with feverish excitement. In 1885 one Quebec
agent received for commissions on passenger business from the incoming ships
destined the west, a cheque for one month’s bookings amounting to $750.00.</p>

<p>Like the late Robert Lewis, long connected with the Lehigh Valley Railroad,
who years ago fished in the wilds of Northern Muskoka and beyond,
Andrew Taylor was a devoted follower of the sport of Isaac Walton. His
regular journeys and explorations in the regions of fish and game were to him
anticipated fixtures and the source of much pleasure and benefit. He visited
many haunts in his time, was considered an authority on ways and means to
fill a creel and color a “meerchaum”. Like Theodore Roosevelt, he “dee-lighted”
to handle a gun and was better than the average as a wing shot.</p>

<p>Passionately fond of outdoor life, with him originated the plan for a permanent
headquarters in the woods, and aided by his associates Messrs. B. H.
Bennett, J. J. Rose, P. G. Van Vleet and Jack Goodsell, the well equipped
lodge of the incorporated Red Chalk Fishing and Game Club, six miles south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
of Bigwin Island in Lake of Bays, was established in Northern Muskoka, with
Andrew Taylor charter president, honorary life member and pater familias of a
sociable brood of thirty sportsmen.</p>

<p>Having been an ex-president of the Victoria Lawn Bowling &amp; Skating
Club and the Western Bowling Association, London, his office was the rendezvous
of curlers and bowling committees as well as fellow members of the Toronto
Lacrosse &amp; Athletic Club.</p>

<p>Few of his friends had more intimate opportunities to realize his characteristics
than myself and one must labor beside a person to obtain the true
perspective. The antithesis of what men describe as a “fourflusher”, he could
not stoop to conquer by unfair means, but was punctilious in observing the code,
in the propriety of personal behaviour, in the composition of a sentence. Although
endowed with Scottish caution, in many ways he was not secretive but
almost boyishly candid and uniformly courteous, patient and generous to a
fault. The confidante of his father, the adviser to a score of relatives, idolized
by his family, A. J. Taylor’s confreres valued his friendship and regarded their
intimacy with him as a golden opportunity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Eighty</span> per cent. of new business secured—after eliminating the advantageous
influence of good advertising well placed—results not from
unusual happenings or quasi-romantic incidents. It originates in pressing
industrial expansion and broad education, it flows through modern
channels, and along those thorny, old-fashioned highways of endeavor such
as persistent, methodical solicitation of passenger and freight traffic, a conscientious
interest in its handling and disposition after acceptance, and above
all depends upon the good will and very essential aid of each one of that
many sided army employed by the transportation corporations whose arteries
provide the means for commercial life’s activities.</p>

<p>Assuming that you desire to introduce or further exploit a worthy service
and route, publicity should be the first vital consideration. In this propaganda
who can better assist you to reach the world and his wife than the rank
and file, than those men and youths of high and low degree whom you meet
when you occasionally call and who, during your absence, are always in immediate
contact with buyers and the stream of enquiring public, alert and receptive,
like a big league star playing close to the third sack.</p>

<p>It has been, let us suppose, a regrettable necessity that prevented officials
from organizing the present desultory practice into a system of at least three
meetings a year when separated railway employees and their superiors could
meet and discuss subjects pertaining to the relations existing between the
company and its patrons. At such anticipated and informal conventions
every one present is urged to express opinions. Traffic matters are viewed
from different angles, the solitary agent who thinks himself and agency discriminated
against, learns the larger reason for local inconvenience, outside
representatives obtain a “close up” inspection of the chiefs in action and the
plan, as a fixture, would become a sound, progressive measure as well as a distinctive
advantage to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> of any transportation company’s staff.</p>

<p>Man is a gregarious, sociable “critter”, fond of exchanging “idears”, an
impressionable, flesh and blood individual quite like yourself, who easily
responds to straightforward, properly timed overtures of the railway and
steamship traveling fraternity, ever willing to concede you an “even break”,
or better, if merited. Collectively they are the Central News Bureau in your
line, diplomatically safeguarding your reasonable expectations. More prospects
come to light, more new business is secured and resolved into renewals
through the agency of ticket sellers and traffic men by the gradual ingratiating
of personality than via any of the other mediums. An indiscreet, pugnacious
official who, for instance, soberly declares that only his company’s wall map
embodies all the virtues invites ridicule and gets it.</p>

<p>Collaborate and hobnob with the nabob in the inner railway or warehouse
sanctum sanctorum, and the next man down, if you will: they deserve that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
deference and “were poor once themselves”, but do not always flock with the headquarters
staff and entirely overlook the other boys, nor the understudy to the
traffic manager of those firms controlling ten cars per week or ten cases a month.
They see and hear unthought of items of interest and possess long memories.
Cultivate your recollection of faces and names, for to-morrow or next season
a clerk may gravitate to “Depot or City Ticket Agent” and opportunity, with
passengers leaving to his guidance and judgment “What route should we
take” and it is to his address that advertising points the finger.</p>

<p>A few companies endeavor to arrange the time and transportation which
enables certain city ticket agents to journey over the main line of their property
for educative reasons, but the experienced assistants are too infrequently included,
are seldom sent on an excursion into outside territory, and never attend
a ticket agents’ association meeting, and yet, the nature of their duties implies
ability to promptly and accurately answer innumerable questions regarding
junction connections, baggage transfer, location of foreign line depots, dining
and sleeping facilities as well as geographical peculiarities. Books there are
that print some of this information, but often the enquirer departs disappointed
without exact details, but to the men who have been over the ground with eyes
open, it is decidedly satisfying to be able to intelligently submit the facts and
note how your statements carry conviction and impress the recipient. Of all
people needing the experience of travel, the ticketing agent who directs others
on their journeys should be first to possess that advantage.</p>

<p>Dispensing to these gentlemen few promises and religiously observing those
is a strong undercurrent in shaping your course. Unfailing attention to reservation
requests, prompt news of the whereabouts of specific shipments, and
early notification of upward tariff revisals, &amp;c., &amp;c., are assets that help forge a
friendship out of which springs new business, which a “fourflusher” or thoughtless
one is prone to overlook after his final handshake. “O consistency, thou
art a jewel.”</p>

<p>In circles where the weed is so popular, the “eternal cigar” is good-naturedly
accepted only as a lubricant to the wheels of conversation, but in the name
of all that is gloomy and peculiar do not insult the intelligence of some captain
of industry, or “regular fellow”, by flashing on him the moment you enter The
Presence, what seems like a transparent bribe in the form of a cheroot a few
degrees better than the “Bartender’s Revenge”. Many of them indulge a
weakness for more delicate fragrance at Half a Dollar for three or two. Because
such a contretemps was studiously avoided by the writer several years
ago, a prominent Hamilton, Canada, merchant—then patronizing a competitor—gave
“our route” a dozen cars of eastbound California fruit and explained
why.</p>

<p>Few transportation people are so sinuous and adept as to be “all things
to all men” without “trimming” and loss of self-respect, where one representative
is quite <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fait</i> with the powers that be, another will make indifferent
headway, but you may note in your log book that these observations outline
some practices which will retain old acquaintances and secure a fair measure
of new business.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Sir William Mackenzie</span>,</p>

<p class="p0 smaller">President, Canadian Northern
Railway System.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">With</span> her feeders and tributaries
tapping the distant, beautiful
valleys of historic Arcadia and a
trunk line that ensures a through fast
freight service from ancient Quebec—an
ideal gateway for men who go down to the
sea in ships—the second steel highway in
Canada’s transcontinental trio stretches
hundreds of miles far and away through
rolling uplands, untouched forests and
waving wheat fields to Burrard Inlet and
flourishing Vancouver, a busy maritime
mart and door to the placid Pacific.</p>

<p>Built or purchased and gradually assembled
by Sir William Mackenzie and
Sir Donald Mann, the capitalization of
the Canadian Northern Railway System,
which will be taken over by the Government
of the Dominion of Canada, has been
reckoned at approximately $43,000 per
mile for 10,000 miles of railway actually
under operation, and during the arbitration
proceedings at Osgoode Hall, Toronto,
Mr. Pierce Butler, St. Paul, Minn., counsel
speaking in behalf of his clients, stated
that the railway was now on a basis of
$50,000,000 gross earnings a year.</p>

<p>Previous to the declaration of war the “C.N.R.” was financed mainly by
British capitalists whose intentions, apart from expected profit, were to directly
increase the yield and transportation facilities for wheat against the possibilities
of war, having in mind how far below consumption was their own production
of the fundamental food.</p>

<p>In 1896 the Manitoba Legislature passed a charter, with land grants, providing
for the construction of the Lake Manitoba Railway &amp; Canal Company,
which was not taken advantage of until 1899, when Messrs. Mackenzie and
Mann purchased and commenced construction from Gladstone, Manitoba, to
Winnipegosis, Manitoba, 123 miles, and operation was inaugurated January
3rd, 1897.</p>

<p>Construction was started the same year on the Manitoba &amp; Southeastern
Railway from Winnipeg to the Great Lakes, and in November, 1898, 45
miles of it were operated, St. Boniface to Marchand.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railway lines in Manitoba were acquired in 1901,
and in the same year the thin edge of the wedge was inserted in Ontario when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Parry Sound rejoiced over its first railway
connection with the outside—a 3.3 mile
spur to a Canada Atlantic Railway junction.</p>

<div id="if_i_096" class="figleft" style="max-width: 14em;">
  <img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="1055" height="1547" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Sir Donald Mann</span>,</p>

<p class="p0 smaller">Vice-President, Canadian Northern
Railway System.</p></div></div>

<p>In 1911 the track-end had reached the
foot-hills of the Rockies and engineers
declare the C.N.R.’s low elevation at the
Yellow Head Pass, and where its line later
decends to the sea by the valleys of the
Thompson and Fraser Rivers through the
Cascade Range, locates the track only a
few feet above tidewater of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p>At one point on the “C.N.R.” mountain
division the track is only 4½ miles from
the base of Mount Robson—altitude
13,068 feet—the highest peak in the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>With the completion of the “C.N.R.”
central Montreal terminal, near Dominion
Square, which is approached by a 3.3
mile double tracked tunnel beneath
Mount Royal, the Directorate will have
an exceptional advantage in being able to
move solid trains from west to east without
backing down from dead-end tracks
or breaking up their train formation.</p>

<p>The “C.N.R.” serves urban centres having more than 1,000 population
containing 90% of the population of the towns and cities of Alberta and 97%
of Saskatchewan, the centre of the wheat belt.</p>

<p>If the system should be extended to connect Toronto with Hamilton it
would then have access to cities and towns aggregating 60% of the town dwellers
of the entire provinces, which also produce 70% of their total manufactured
products.</p>

<p>In 1916 the “C.N.R.” carried 132,000,000 bushels of grain: if reduced to
flour and the manufactured flour which it transported be added thereto, the
foodstuffs from territory along the “C.N.R.” would be sufficient to supply the
British Isles’ 45,000,000 population with four pounds of bread each per week for
six months. The “C.N.R.” should therefore, be regarded, especially since the
advent of war, as an essential to the life of the Empire.</p>

<p>Statistics go to show that in the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Nova
Scotia, where the principal Canadian pulp and paper mills are situated, those
of the greatest capacity—or 53% of the total capacity—are situated exclusively
on “C.N.R.” lines.</p>

<p>For the year that ended with July, 1916,
the exports of paper amounted to $21,680,000
of which 88% went to the United States, and
the total exports of pulpwood, pulp and paper
for that year were valued at $40,865,266.
United States consumers gladly took 87% of
this immense output, but the United Kingdom
received only 6%.</p>

<p>During 1917, 85,000,000 feet of British
Columbia lumber, in 3,850 cars, were handled
by “C.N.R.” to the Prairie Provinces and
Eastern Canada. Balsam and Douglas fir,
red cedar, spruce, hemlock, &amp;c., predominated.
Silver spruce for aeroplanes came also,
and as a result of the efforts of the Imperial
Munitions Board the output of the latter has
been recently doubled, the monthly production
at present being approximately
1,200,000 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Moore, Secretary of “C.N.R.”,
in “Railway Nationalization and the Average
Citizen”, makes some clear and terse comparisons
of deep interest to the public
spirited tax-payer anent the government’s
aid given in cash, land and guaranteed bonds
to “C.N.R.”, and subsidiary properties, and
also to other Canadian railways, especially
the Canadian Pacific Railway. He sets down that the “C.N.R.” received

<p>The Dominion Government’s Board of Arbitrators—Sir William Meredith,
Chief Justice Harris and Wallace Nesbitt, K.C.,—which submitted a report as
to the value of 600,000 shares of Canadian Northern Railway common stock,
consumed 50 days from March to the middle of May in hearing the testimony
of legal counsel and valuation experts, the proceedings totalling over 1,500,000
words of evidence and costing about $100,000.</p>

<p>The Board’s award of $10,800,000 for
the railway stock valuated, exceeded by
$800,000 the limit for same made by Act
of Parliament, which was $10,000,000.</p>

<p>Each group of participating principals
paid its own costs, but the Government
bore the cost of taking the evidence.</p>

<p>The Dominion Government is perfecting
a plan whereby the “C.N.R.” will be
operated as a corporation under a board
of directors to be appointed by the Government.
Time will tell if this method
reaches fruition.</p>

<p>The total liabilities being taken over
by the Government in connection with
the “C.N.R.” are $438,264,377.67 and
the assets sum up to $528,437,885.74.</p>

<p>Speaking for himself and also voicing
the views of Sir Donald Mann and Third
Vice-President D. B. Hanna, Sir William
Mackenzie contended that the “C.N.R.”
was destined to be an essential factor in
the expansion of this country and that in
the opinion of the transportation experts
who had examined the situation, their
properties would be particularly useful
in the reconstruction days on which this
land must soon enter. He said his associates had devoted the best of their
years in developing the system to the present state of efficiency and confidently
relied on the future to justify their work and estimates of values.</p>

swarming over the hilly, rock-ribbed areas of Temagami, the dales of Temiskaming
and Porcupine’s budding principality of golden promise.</p>

<p>As the newcomer’s eyes view the sea of tapering masts—shorn of drapery
in winter—and the springtimes’ green undergrowth crowning summits and
slopes, which in that corner of the Canadian hinterland undoubtedly conceal
unconjectured lodes of mineral wealth, his brain tabulates new and fascinating
impressions respecting this vast heritage and pregnant land of the future.</p>

<p>With the theodolite adjusted for action beside the site of a gateway to the
proposed Georgian Bay Ship Canal, and shaping a course North-starward
from historic environs once traversed by intrepid Frenchmen, the Ontario
Government’s Railway Commission began in 1902 the construction of a colonization
line from the City of North Bay, (lying 226 miles above Toronto), to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the region known as the “Clay Belt” of Northern Ontario. With the discovery
of silver on the “LaRose” property in 1903, the output of which during the
subsequent thirteen years amounted to $135,809,222 in silver value from the
camp, together with $4,000,000 from arsenic, cobalt and nickel, the building
of the Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario Railway was promptly extended until
it reached 253 miles into the interior, making easily accessible a restful, inspiring
panorama of diversified lake and landscape. Here it is that Uncle Sam’s
sweltering Southerners and their Northern cousins migrate with the birds in
ever increasing numbers to fish the virgin streams, to sense exhaling aromatic
fragrance and be soothed by the solitude and majesty of the wilderness which
appeals more and more to each contemplative one who would elude the madding
crowd as he jogs adown the irregular pathway of life.</p>

<p>If the waters of silent Lake Nipissing could speak as they flow along, what
whisperings from wigwam, of tribal feuds and exploring missionary priests
would they not bequeath to posterity. But now, into this region of log cabin,
birch bark and bittern those great civilizers, the twin ribbons of steel, have
intruded; sleeping cars mosaic tiled and ornate, traveling via the Grand Trunk
Railway from Toronto, Canadian Pacific Railway from Montreal and “U.S.A.”
at Buffalo, are delivered daily to the
Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario Railway
and circumventing space, lay bare to their
prying, adventurous occupants, many of
the secrets of nature in the north.</p>

<p>As you bowl along past thicket, lake
and narrow ledge to the regular accompaniment
of that peculiar circus wagon
“cluck, cluck”, emitted in winter by the
twelve wheelers, you unconsciously
wonder if it were mink, otter, lynx or
fox whose softly falling pads made the
trail which bisects the otherwise unruffled
white mantle covering the frozen surface
yonder. Meanwhile, the telltale tracks
of the early morning prowlers vanish
abruptly where the waters frozen boundary
gives way to battalions of balsam, spruce
and jack pine silently guarding the ascent
to rising ground. The view begets reflection:
when casually discussing the autumn
hunt with a deer slayer who annually
roams that region, nimrod complacently
informed me that he had left the train at
mileage “22” from North Bay, and before
the locomotive whistled on a nearby hill
his first buck was bagged. At this juncture
an Indian guide from out the forest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
setting surrounding Lady Evelyn Lake came aboard at Temagami’s commodious,
artistically conceived depot of split hardheads, and grinning
broadly, substantiated the boaster’s declaration with such terseness and
force that a group of globe trotting mine prospectors and sportsmen grew
interested. Rifles, fish, fur and game laws started every mother’s son of
them talking, and the jolly wiseacres continued their conversazione crossing
Net Lake, past Rib Lake and its woodie approaches, and on to where Jack
Frost had transferred Bay Lake, Wind Lake, Moose Lake and Red Pine Lakes,
into cubes of crystal transparence. They did not desist until permitted a
glimpse through car window of the Montreal River’s splashing, rapids tossed
waters at Latchford and the developing timber possibilities at this ford, which
are often duplicated along the 360 miles of this stream’s course.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were a cosmopolitan assemblage recruited from several
and diverse regions, but all were heading towards Lake Temagami, Cobalt,
Lorrain and Porcupine City’s newer, veiled enticements. Gnarled and seasoned,
a veteran campaigner on “many a foreign strand” sat silently observant
beside a sturdy novice, self-possessed and hopeful, encased in flannel shirt, regulation
shooting boots laced high and a cow boy hat, who had yet to know hunger
and the thrill of a “strike”. That composite character from the cities, merchant-miner-speculator
evolved from the silver excitement, was there with his
pigeon blood cravat pin and nonchalant demeanor, exchanging deductions with
a facing stranger. Some one drew cork and with a mild libation all round the
smoker, tongue cords loosed and a Kentuckian garbed in Mackinaw cloth knee
breeches, heavy black stockings and Jaeger cap, narrated pleasantly tales of the
diggings in Australia, California, Cripple Creek. A man who had been in
Johannesburg talked knowingly of John Hays Hammond and the conductor
tarried a moment on his rounds. Now and then, from out the babel you pieced
together, “It sold this morning for—”, “Commercial arsenic”, “Rock drills”,
“For stealing whiskey I smashed him on the—”, “Three and one half a share,
five dollars par”, and much more in the vernacular. They were encumbered
with the latest, likewise the most ancient caper in portmanteaux: they carried
fire arms, hatchets, and snow shoes, coats of fewer colors than Joseph’s, but of
patterns innumerable, and pack sacks stuffed like the bundles Tony shoulders
when hurrying to the base of grim Vesuvius. Withal, they were a merry and
optimistic company off to re-discover Champlain’s own territory, to learn that
cobalt is a pinkish chemical by-product found beside silver, that single carload
shipments of silver concentrates mined here have netted $142,231.00, that the
camp’s dividends from silver and gold for 14 years realized $81,320,625, that
rolling stock of railways all over America help to brighten “T. &amp; N.O.” rails,
that the town of Cobalt is outlandishly picturesque and unique with cartwheel,
Bostonlike thoroughfares where Madame promenades in the velvet so recently
au fait on Pall Mall and Broadway, while an Indian girl in moccasins stares
across the divide through the window of the Golden Moon in the hope of discerning
her lethargic beau. Vein sampling engineers, grubstakers, rock-worms,
mine captains, prospectors and agents in coats of “astrachan goose”, fur lined
or skin covered shooting jackets and everything else but tarpaulins, strut about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and add to their kit, each man jack of them probably thinking he has “a nose
for ore” and inside information. The oriental ear pendant also abounds,
gracing the lobes of sundry vivacious French lassies at the cinematograph:
dog trains await, Jacques the habitant, in capot, sash and pipe in mouth “Bon
jeurs” along the even tenor of his way, while Poles, Finns and Cockney ’arry
do not deliberately jostle you off the lumpy little board walk to the nearby
excavation. Stalwart, brass buttoned Ontario and Dominion police are everywhere.
Cobalt’s roots spread far below the surface. Underground detonations
indicate that compressed air drills day and night slowly blast a mammoth
sewerway for this hustling town. Not every one knows that beneath the “T.
&amp; N.O.R.” highway and handsome modern station building the Right of Way
Mining Company tunnels for ore. A few hundred yards beyond and under the
bottom of frozen Cobalt Lake, over which the dutiful citizen crosses on Sabbath
and holyday to Father Forget’s cleanly, white painted church, the Cobalt Lake
Mining Company is extending drives, crosscuts and leads seeking material that
produces mineral which pleases magnates and sets the stock market operators
by the ears. $1,085,000 was paid to the Government for this right. Thus
does the south lag behind the north.</p>

impetuousity at Ragged Chutes on the Montreal River, at Hound Chute also, and at
the Matabitchouan River, and not afar off the cottage in which it is said Doctor
Drummond’s sympathetic spirit forsook its mortal tabernacle, keeps solitary
vigil on a slope overlooking Kerr Lake. His inimitable habitant patois verse
survives however, and is kept green in memory when interpreted by the nimble
tongues of M. Giles or an Olive Pouze. Occasionally grazing the brink of a
declivity when touring the camp, one meets wheeling or gliding past on sled
behind good horses, miner’s wife from Montana or a courier in shoe packs and
cold weather rig astride a sturdy, sure-footed pony. Jogging along after him
the next is a native on a mustang. Similarly mounted a rangy, vigorous
individual clad in seamy corduroys, jacket, ear flaps and the inevitable “larrigans”
lopes by. This personage proves to be unintentionally traveling incog,
as he is a big mine manager, an English expert doting on tetrahedrite crystals,
heading to town for a constitutional and the morning mail.</p>

<p>As recently as midnight of August 19th, 1912, an undignified and profane
pilgrimage to the shrine of the goddess of fortune occurred in Temiskaming. At
the stroke of twelve a ziz-zagging procession of flickering lights born by all
manner of men, stretching from Cobalt three miles to the famous, now naked
Gillies Timber Limit, broke into motion at the double quick. Ahead of them
were twelve square miles—4,000 acres—or twenty acres of undiagnosed area
of rock each for the lucky two hundred eager, excited prospectors and adventurers
who might stake, find ore and register for $10 at Haileybury first, and thus
perchance, stumble on a king’s ransom. Ordinarily, the journey on steam
coach costs Ten Cents. This night one bold spirit chartered a special train for
$50.00 hoping to outstrip the throng afoot and horseback, in autos and on bicycles,
armed as they were with a Five Dollar mining license and panting for place.
For an hour or two the nervous strain was intense and the schemes and ruses
resorted to for advantage were numerous and crafty. Sweating relay horses
clattered at top speed all night between the new diggings and the district seat,
positions held in person or proxy in the line-up waiting for dawn reminded one
of the nocturnal vigil and struggle for tickets to behold the late Sir Henry
Irving, while rumor and conjecture were rife. One energetic but luckless individual,
with boundary stakes in earth, had them uprooted and tossed aside by
a speculator’s hireling the moment he headed to the registry office; another
collapsed from exhaustion and laid prone in the bush as the strong trod over
his body and aspirations and still a third poor devil lost a pronounced advantage
by falling, horse and rider, into a quagmire at the roadside, and all because
there lies side by side beneath the earth’s surface silver sidewalks and blighted
hopes.</p>

<p>Do not conclude that the term “rough diamonds” would fitly describe the
mining body of to-day nor opine that they always talk gold at $20 the ounce,
assay furnaces, vanners and recording tachometers. Their personnel includes
a mighty spry collection of thoroughbreds of advanced education from everywhere.
They are men fond of horse-flesh and saddle; men who aim straight
at billiard ball or bob cat and a percentage can coax sweet strains from piano
or at odd moments resort to the not violent and refining pleasure of gardening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
I have seldom seen a gaudier conglomeration of old-fashioned bloom than the
flowers before the bungalow of the Temiskaming Mine. In their offices and
apartments several enjoy club comforts and trophies and articles of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">virtu</i> adorn
the walls of highly polished logs. They can “diagnose the field” for a close
corporation and by theory and experience prophecy what may be found under
the crust away east to Des Joachins (des swish aw) Falls, Lake St. John and
Chibougamou. The gentleman who cheerfully volunteered, flashlight in hand,
to pilot the writer to where drillers pierced rock at mine bottom, wore riding
breeches, jacket and English spring leggings of the most approved design and
a stunning waistcoat encircled his athletic proportions. He proved to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
raconteur with reminisences of “Ole Lunnon” and the Riviera, but swore
fealty to Ireland’s joyous effervescence.</p>

<p>The legacy of this untrodden expanse is unlimited productiveness of soil,
waterways and forest. The solitary explorer with pack horse and canoe spyed
out a winding trail which the railways’ impedimenta of progress has speedily
straightened and made easy for the quasi pioneer. The rolling ground and
gentle slopes in the vicinity of Haileybury are pleasant to see. Here the clay
belt and husbandman replaces rock and miner and the view from this town and
farmer’s mecca—which boasts the unique feature of a floating market place—out
and over Lake Temiskaming and across to where the mists conceal a quaint
French settlement, Villa Marie, is indeed charming. On learning that the mission
bells pealed and a convent dwelt within the borders of Quebec just over
that moonlit expanse of inland sea, I confess my conception of interprovincial
geography seemed out of alignment. Englehart, a divisional point, bears the
name of the Railway Commission’s astute, public spirited Chairman, Jacob
L. Englehart, formerly of Cleveland, Ohio, who made his Canadian debut in
the Petrolia oil belt, and some forty years ago supported Commodore Cornelius
Vanderbilt when he was married in the Tecumseh Hotel, London, Canada, to
the beautiful Mrs. Crawford of Baton Rouge, La. Jacob Englehart inaugurated
the system of greenhouses which flourish in those leagues of loam and
clay but the plants which predominate in that “neck of the woods”, however,
are those that grow into thousands of cords of coveted pulpwood, cut in certain
districts by private owners and on reserves with Government sanction. As
this commodity underlies in a vital way the immense paper and publishing
interests of America and Europe the supply, method of treatment, market and
duty tax has become a burning topic in factory and forum both sides of the international
boundary.</p>

<p>Those wind tossed forest monarchs and old pines on the hill tops that once
beheld naught save the Redskin stalking an hundred animate creatures of the
wild, will if spared, witness a mighty trek northward. The caravan of the white
man of every clime and craft shall push past haunts of black bear, moose and
trapper, portaging enroute near Cochrane beside Frederick House River. At
this spot an incident at Barbers Bay in the semi-savage days of the old trading
posts of the north country, has become a fearsome tradition among the indians
of the Abitibi. Many years ago when the Hudson Bay Company were extending
trading posts southward from Moose Factory, Frederick Barber with
Indians and voyageurs established a store beside a bay perpetuating his name,
at Frederick House Lake. One Christmas eve Macdougall, a halfbreed, and
two companions reached the post to trade their autumn catch. Together with
gifts Barber unfortunately dispensed rum. When refused more liquor the
trappers murdered all hands and seized the fort. Fearing discovery and punishment
of their crime, the drunken half-breeds killed every Indian who came
to the post with furs. Growing anxious, several squaws who had not accompanied
their braves on the midwinter journey, snow-shoed to Barbers Bay and
were imprisoned by Macdougall. One woman escaped and organized an avenging
party which did not arrive in time to prevent the massacre of the remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
squaws nor the flight of the halfbreed
scoundrels. Then began a
long chase down the Black and
Abitibi Rivers. Macdougall who
was tobagganing loot from the
fort, was nearly overtaken in
camp. He saw the trackers coming
and started across Lake
Abitibi, disappearing during a
brief snow storm and was never
seen after. The Indians gave evil
spirits the credit when he vanished
and they suppose the half-breed’s
ghost still lingers over the lakes.
It is across these trackless
fastnesses, under whispering
Northern Lights, that the newest
national highway, the National
Trans-continental &amp; Grand Trunk
Pacific Systems, dreamt of by the
patriot the Right Honorable Sir
Wilfrid Laurier, gradually
assumed reality and now hasten
communication westward with
tidings from the east.</p>

<p>Yea, the crusade will not
cease until little old Ontario is
linked with the Aurora Borealis
and the venturesome commoner
at Frisco, New Orleans and
Toronto may side step the soaring
bovine market, and after an all-rail
journey, harpoon his own walrus meat in James and Hudson’s Bays.</p>

<span class="subhead small">Some methods of the men who control their movements</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> Mademoiselle Susanna Vere de Vere, haughty and capricious,
talcumed and beflounced, rides east at 10:00 a.m., ensconsced in
green plushed parlor car comfort, think you she recognizes as she rolls
along, the significance of the irregular hedge that flanks for miles her chosen
pathway? Can she see in that jagged sky line of uneven box car roofs, so unlike
the matched uniformity of the coral beads in her necklace—the source
of the revenue which purchased the ornament? Probably not. Does Oliver
Opulence across the isle, with fattening jowls and the latest periodical, attribute
his golfing privileges and bank balance to the agency of the lowly
freight car? No, not in the fullest measure.</p>

<p>The routine duties of John Jones Limited in to-day’s strenuous commercial
struggle are based entirely on what freight service has done or will accomplish
for them, and during conferences with their purchasing and traffic assistants,
concrete equipment needs are dealt with daily but the vital usefulness of each
empty car as a retainer and carrier are thought of only in an abstract way, yet
they are as essential as the “G.T.R.” or three daily meals. Not until such
time as the advent of an industrial calamity that will destroy them all, leaving
coal man, merchant and bacon baron stranded high and dry, will shippers
unanimously appreciate their individual worth, and not until then will cease
the desire of corporate interests to haul their valuable loads along this or that
favored highway of steel. Not a pulley in manufacture could turn without
their direct aid, meagre would be the housewives’ meals and pelts again be
their children’s portion if the wheels refused to whirr: then indeed, would
Mademoiselle Susanna Vere de Vere understand the sudden death of Pullman
palaces from commercial paralysis.</p>

<p>A tortuous string of seventy freight cars in motion is not what you would
designate as a “harmonious whole” in appearance. They remind you of a
herd of elephants with baggy pants traveling trunk to tail, nor do these incongruous,
ill-at-ease assortments of traffic <em>proletariat</em> pick their company. The
tall and the short, the lame, the halt and the blind they have always with them,
and if a trig, shiny aristocrat once, costing approximately $1,200 to $1,500,
(but to-day twice as much) that should be on his owner’s tracks, strays into
line with this perambulating Coxey’s Army he soon gets the spots knocked off
him, like a “rookie” enlisted with the regulars. They all receive awful treatment,
they are side tracked, snubbed and roughly handled and though doctored,
patched, likewise overburdened, they return more good for evil by feeding mice
and men and machinery than any other medium. The funniest feature about
these democratic go-betweens is that a loose jointed, squatty old party, rocking
from side to side with the load in his protruding stomach and hardly able
to keep step with the tribe, may have his “innards” stuffed with silks and
satins to bedeck some slavish goddess of fashion who never appreciates what
ship brought the feathers and finery to port—and such is human nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>However, the officials of every railroad company from the president, traffic
manager and “G.F.A.”, down the ladder to the journal oilers, make recompense,
court the freight cars and strive mightily for the privilege of transporting
their variegated contents and these are the men who make them make millions.
It is a game with far reaching ramifications, a contest of competitors
where brains and dispatch, service, sentiment and cold figures diversify the play.
Some times it is as uncertain and exciting as draw poker with a brazen bluff
cropping up, but the line that can deliver the goods usually scores and gathers
in the ducats. The nets are out every hour of the twenty-four and they are
out at every important geographical centre on the continent, making the sport
in variety and complexion, more devoid of monotony than most mundane
pursuits.</p>

<p>Traffic men seek every commodity from a carload of lemonade straws to
a shipment of zinc dust from Japan for the Porcupine Mines, they talk on every
topic from tunnel clearances to the effect of the Budget, and have interviewed
specimens of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">genus homo</i> as yet uncharted by the phrenologists. They
study tact and diplomacy, but few have equalled the art of a Manitoba farmer
whom it has been said, kept himself in coal for the winter by making faces at
the passing “C.P.R.” firemen and engineers. Customers’ wishes, siding accommodation,
enclosures, cartage, part lots, classification, temperature, icing and
a thousand other conditions influence the movement. Among freight men
resourcefulness is an ever present adjunct in devising ways and means to enlist
adherence, placate the public, overcome delay and get around an obstacle,
recalling the expedient of a new shedman who was puzzled as to how he could
load in the “way” car a piece of crated machinery too large for the door. He
resorted to the alternative of removing the casing, then easily transferring the
unwieldly consignment inside and after recrating, left the later problem to the
man who would deliver the goods.</p>

<p>“Work well begun is half done” saith the old saw, and the sage was right.
Starting on a few calls some pleasant morning with the outside atmosphere
exhilarating, if your initial visit happens on one of those considerate, business
gentlemen who can devote three to thirty minutes of his time to your mission,
and concluding the X.Y.Z. road might be worse, promises a share of the traffic
he has offering, you usually approach the balance of the day’s duties with
optimism. Experiences multiply, but this feeling will probably carry you past
the resentful individual who holds a little stock of your Company and refuses
business because his security is temporarily dropping and it will likewise help
to cement acquaintance with the cautious man who would like to but fears his
couple of cars would be held up or lost should Canada and the United States
drift into war. Emboldened to continue the good work, you harken to the
complaints of one of your local agents, both officious and secretive—who sends
all his correspondence in under separate cover and wonders why it don’t receive
prompt attention when the chief is away. If diminuitive this representative
might become a detriment and antagonize trade and his running mate is the
agent appointed by the operating department who proves a thorn in the flesh
of the Division Freight Agent by snarling, rat-terrier, dictatorial demeanor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
until the shipping body in unanimous resolution declare “that agent cannot
leave quick enough to suit me”. Hot on the heels of the visiting “D.F.A.”,
who is supposed by many to always have an easy time, bobs up an obsequious
Hebrew at the period of great car shortage, with a tale of woe about a man coming
upon him just as he was loading a few bales and shouting “Here, what are
you doing with my car?” It developed that the blusterer could not procure
a car himself and bethought him to pounce on the inoffensive rag man and purloin
the coveted empty box car.</p>

<p>Fortified by an agreement with an anxious fresh fruit buyer, whereby he
is guaranteed forty refrigerator cars in return for their haul homeward a few
hundred miles, a call is made on a canned salmon distributor. This is his
acknowledgment to your opening salute. “Who told you I had a car of
salmon? I have no salmon and am not thinking of fish just now—this isn’t
Friday”. However, he proved amenable to reason and issued a routing order.</p>

<p>A Grand Trunk Railway commercial agent related to me recently the
following outline of a verbal castigation administered to himself by a mourner
who must have been wearing indigo spectacles: “The idea of giving business
to ‘U.M.C.’ lines, we’ll have no truck or trade with them. It is very indiscreet
of you to dare to try; when you can compete on an equal basis with the ‘C.P.R.’
then come in”. A well intentioned, but premature overture earned one young
general agent, new to his territory, an undeserved rebuke in response to his
civil enquiries: “Well, I guess I hav’nt anything to say to you to-day”.</p>

<p>“I came in primarily to ask you to take luncheon with me, would you
join me at one o’clock?”</p>

<p>“No, I had my lunch at the proper hour” came the quick rejoinder.
Fortunately, the balance of the day was spent among “white men” of whom
there are 95 per cent. naturally inclined to transact business with reason and
decency, and their broad guage tendency seems to expand in proportion to the
magnitude and responsibility of their undertakings.</p>

<p>Another gentleman occasioned a good deal of laughter telling on himself
the story of taking his new chief on an introductory tour and being embarrassed
to learn that the first manufacturer they called on had been dead for a year,
and the second one, whom our friend knew to some extent, asking him what
his name was. It takes time to talk away or live down these little incidents.
Now and then a modest shipper with about one car a year traveling in your
direction, will unblushingly suggest that he be loaned one of your annual passes
for a little trip down to New York, and I recall hearing of a wallet of transportation,
in the wrong hands, being lost in the railway yards near Rochester.</p>

<p>A number of the boys remember certain shippers who have had an insatiable
longing for some substantial token in reciprocity for the traffic they could
control, with a leaning towards a variety of household furnishings and what-nots.</p>

<p>Patronage lists and their influence, if operative the wrong way, are often
the invention of the evil one and nullify the efforts of a conscientious worker,
otherwise in good standing with all parties. One day Billy A——, General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Freight Agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, called with a traveling representative
on a certain undesignated Canadian biscuit factory: out came the list
with the statement of the egregious young manager that “Your road is not using
our product on its diners.”</p>

<p>“Well,” promptly responded the truthful William, “It may be they are
not good enough”.</p>

<p>To elaborate further, a contractor erecting a building in a distant city for
a firm doing a large outfitting and general selling business, routed twelve carloads
of structural steel that he required, via the “P.D.Q.R.” A wide awake,
aggressive competitor coveted the haul of the material and meant to have it.
They promptly placed an $80,000 order for hotel requisites with the outfitting
firm and the latter, feeling the pressure where it was intended to be felt,
capitulated, assuaged the contractor’s rising ire in a monetary but lesser degree,
which, of course, jilted the expectations of the “P.D.Q.R.”</p>

<p>A competing line with heavy purchasing appropriations has been known
to often frustrate genuine tonnage hopes by wiring that the name of a shipper
interested in a transaction, be removed from their patronage lists unless he immediately
saw the error of his ways and banished consideration for a rival route
or an M.P., in Victoria, B.C., we’ll say, may exert some influence he may have
and busy himself by telegraphing to forward specific public works supplies
from the east this way or that.</p>

<p>The staff of a district freight department may do considerable preparatory
work regarding, for instance, the movement of Australian and New Zealand
wool for Europe to find their plans upset by a necessary war-time embargo
affecting the transport of sheep skins and crossbred wool through this port or
that country.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bete noir</i> of all railroad men is the shifty, unprincipled person who
deceives you with a misleading yarn and means to do something else. A sample
of this method of operating is outlined in the case following, and concerns a
carload of pianos going from an Ontario town to Vancouver, B.C. Knowing his
man, the consignee had telegraphed and also written the shippers “Route our
car now loading ‘N.C.O. &amp; B.R.R.’: under no circumstances deviate, pay no
attention to other instructions, this is final.” To dull the watchfulness of the
interested railways, Ananias declared the shipment would be held pending
the arrival from elsewhere of an enclosure of four pianos, meanwhile laboring
secretly to dispatch the complete shipment in the <em>interim</em> contrary to instructions.
Temporarily balked in his fell purpose, to disarm suspicion when interrogated,
he actually ordered placed on his siding a suitable car as a screen or
camouflage, but pursued his original plan. Not until repeatedly disciplined
by the head office did this factory manager desist and finally unload the forbidden
car and obey orders. Such an employee is a stumbling block to progressive
business.</p>

<p>Disappointments and neck and neck finishes are frequent, but variety is
the spice and fascinating magnet in railroading life and when shrewd manufacturers
repudiate narrowness by distributing the plums among a number, “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
fell on their necks with loud cries”, as handsome
Jack McGuire of the “C.P.R.” would say. These
incidents are reminiscent of a whiskey traveler
who alleges he interviewed at Chicago the superintendent
of dining cars for a well known railroad.
To quote his own words “I paid proper attention
to my personal appearance, wore my Persian
lamb-skin coat and anticipated an order”. Contrary
to expectations, however, the interview fell
flat, no contract was made and for years after,
this crestfallen liquor man went out of his way to
divert his company’s shipments away from that
line via other channels, to the discomfiture of railway
men in no way responsible and notwithstanding
the fact that the offending Dining Car Superintendent
stoutly contended it was not his road
but another that was unappreciative or stocked
with rye. Speaking of the commissariat department,
George Tootle, the widely known dining
car waiter on the G.T.R.’s famous International
Limited train, who thinks lunch counters breed
nervousness and indigestion, relates observing
at Chicago the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p>A “hayseedy” looking man with field mice
jumping out of his whiskers, walked up to the
lunch counter, seated himself on a stool, placed
his bright-colored carpet bag on the next stool and partook of a hearty lunch.
He passed the young man a $1 bill to take out the price of his lunch, 50
cents, and was surprised when the youth said: “Not any change, sir; your
carpet bag occupied a seat, and we must collect for that.”</p>

<p>The old man looked dazed for a second only, and then replied:</p>

<p>“All right, my boy”, and opening the bag, exclaimed, “Old carpet bag, I
have paid for your lunch and you shall have it.”</p>

<p>Quicker than a flash he threw in a mince pie, a plate of doughnuts and several
sandwiches, and departed amid the shouts of everyone in the station.</p>

<p>One does not mind unintentionally stumbling on a hasty eruption in temper
of a decent chap who has just found five of his letters opened by intent or on
the part of a careless firm with a similar name, but we would rather not be
granted an audience with an apple exporter who fathers four hundred barrels
of fruit lying on the dock at Halifax ready for a ship’s hold at the psychological
moment when an inspector condemns the lot because the centres are filled
with undersized apples.</p>

<p>Tenacity of purpose and “Never say die”—which compel results—are
well exemplified by a happening that came to my notice some years ago,
involving two cars of shoes which were routed and definitely promised to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
trans-continental line. A rival corporation sent a city solicitor after them
without securing the footwear. The city freight agent then essayed the task
with like success. Undaunted the “D.F.A.” was the next to try, but the
shipper remaining firm stuck to his guns when the fourth application was
made in the person of the freight traffic manager. The news spread and on
Wednesday evening of that week, when the gentleman who shewed such valor
in defending his citadel of shoe leather, to the accompaniment of the silent
prayers of the party of the first part, called at the president’s residence to visit
his daughter, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">denouement</i> hung fire no longer. A word, under such circumstances
from the high official proved sufficient and the loser then understood
the quotation, “An idol but with feet of clay.”</p>

<p>An active traveling agent and irresistible business getter told me once
of a prominent London firm promising him a carload if he would remain absent
for six months, of another who suggested “Sell some goods for us and we will
favor your route,” while the third—an old ‘Q’ employee who claimed the
‘Q’ was a large family—looking at his watch, said “Wait twenty minutes.”
Waiting twenty minutes is a nerve-racking ordeal that also affects a gentleman’s
prestige and a better method of procedure would be to pre-arrange a
meeting out of deference to the demands on busy people’s time. It is awkward,
after traveling some distance for the purpose, to find on meeting the member
of Messrs. Frett &amp; Growl Limited, that he will not meet your eye, will not
shew signs of animation, but with head down apparently saving his breath
for a long distance race, terminates the interview in melancholy with “No!”</p>

<p>There was a traffic official in an eastern metropolis some years ago, representing
a fine railroad but kept in the chair by other people’s financial power,
who was notorious for that stealthy, furtive habit of fumbling with his papers
without looking up, as though fearful his eyes would convict him of his sins
against men.</p>

<p>In the category of queer ones could be listed the eccentric who accosted
a friend of mine, now doing trustworthy executive work for the government
railways, with “What, you here again?”</p>

<p>“Just for three minutes, Sir, to place a routing order!” “You won’t be
here a minute, I’m too busy. I can’t be bothered by you and your routing
order; it isn’t worth the paper it is written on.” With people like this
unmuzzled and at large, can you wonder at the increase in crime.</p>

<p>Another good acquaintance who was invited to an inner office to unburden
his mind and concisely recited the nature of his business without molestation,
was dumbfounded when finished to observe the creature before him, without
parley, touch a buzzer, summon a servitor and request him to “Shew this
gentleman out.” What would you rather do than live with him? Some men’s
physical boundaries and narrow-minded outlook are so small and contemptible
that if a mosquito laid out a nine hole golf course on their torso he would
be crowded for room.</p>

<p>A decade or so ago there dwelt in a town an hour’s ride east of Toronto,
an individual like a ruffled grouse who thought to slay his interviewer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
summarily with “What you tell me goes in one ear and out the other,” as he made
a personally conducted tour to the door. Quickly came the retort courteous:
“I am not surprised Mr. —— there is nothing there to stop it.”</p>

<p>Now comes that robust type that would probably not wince when getting
it back in kind if his antagonist could fittingly measure up to his standard in
words and deeds. Picture the horned and forbidding monster, swollen with
pride of place, who greets the caller as though he were going to swallow him
whole and allow his gastric juice to do the rest: “Well, your company has
one H— of a nerve to send you out here asking me for business: you built
a station, some big contracts were let, but you were all looking out of the window
when I wanted a slice,” finishing with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup de grace</i>, “What have you got to
say about that?” His caller replied, “I guess our management took a leaf
out of your book; how much of your business have we handled in the past
ten years, tell me that? We learn to know who our friends are and when we
have some favors to place we don’t hurry with them on a platter to the people
who forget our route, but try to remember those who realize that if we are
lucky we run a train or two about once a week out west.” The lengths to which
some folks will go to make personal a neutral issue is astonishing. A man who
had been employed in Chicago by a firm that could not prevail on the “C. &amp; A.”
to give them an order, came to Canada to work for an Ontario industry and
expressed his intention to gratify that grudge by witholding shipments of the
new employer from the railway he had placed under the ban.</p>

<p>The book of boors will admit of one more entry, being a letter I have
permission to reproduce, which was addressed to one snob by a conscientious
and sensitive young agent who has since transferred his energies to another
channel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear <span class="locked">Sir—</span></p>

<p><span class="in2">The</span> three sentences <span class="locked">below—</span></p>

<p><span class="in2">“Who</span> are you and what do you want?” “I would be ashamed to be
so unpatriotic as to work for Yankee employers.”</p>

<p><span class="in2">“I’ll</span> give you fellows business only when I’m in a hole and cannot do
otherwise!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="in8">form</span> the subject of this communication and are exactly the
text and sense of part of two conversations which occurred between you and
myself—involuntarily on my part—and only because I was acting on
orders while in the capacity of an employee of a “U.S.A.” railway seeking a
share of the routing of the freight traffic you purchased in the United States
or shipped westward, and which, unfortunately, you controlled.</p>

<p>No longer situated where behavior and language like yours has
opportunity to grievously test the patience of myself, (and several others),
permit me to allude to the impression you create.</p>

<p>When people of your calibre, quite devoid of consideration and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i>, receive a business proposition with a verbal attack couched in the
tone and vernacular of your moulding shop, they are, no doubt, running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
true to form, but they take refuge behind the assumption that there is
no one to question their attitude.</p>

<p>In doing so they indulge in a cowardly advantage over gentlemen
who, by the nature of their employment, from president down, always
have to remember the officials higher up; remember also, that in giving free
rein to their human resentment, they may be rewarded with a letter of
complaint, half true and half garbled, sent in by some cad to an officer
disloyal enough to first believe the outsider.</p>

<p>Reflect on how disconcerted your son might feel were he to experience
the misfortune of meeting a sour tempered individual like yourself
when first coming in contact with the commercial public. He could not
do himself justice nor serve you well.</p>

<p>The proverb says “One cannot make a silken purse out of a sow’s
ear,” and although it is difficult to rebuild what the man in the street
characterizes as a “rough neck,” it is never too late to mend.</p>

<p>The isolated class referred to are known by representatives of all
businesses and are tacitly ostracized when the army of decent fellows is
being discussed.</p>

<p>“<em>Please heed the handwriting on the wall</em>”</p>

<p>That man was “misfit” who should have been polishing apples for a
Greek—to quote Jack Rose, an original wit.</p>

<p>After bidding adieu to the friendly personage who has accepted a mild
cigar, but uncontented, megaphones to a couple of others at the rear in this
wise, “Here Jake and Eddie, get in on the cigars,” our conversation in the
“smoker” again reverted to pianos and things harmonious and cheerful.
Genial M. T. Case recounted how fire, while in transit, ruined a carload of
pianos when en route the west and the firm’s western manager, a believer in
long odds, filed a claim for reimbursement, itemizing the instruments at $500
each. When the railway company received the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">billet doux</i> they blinked and
may have said “For the love of Mike” or something less classical and affectionate.
However, as soon as the firms attention was drawn to the amount of
the claim the manager, with good judgment, clipped $200 off each piano and
a prompt settlement was arranged.</p>

<p>Only a few months ago an organized band of box car and freight shed
thieves stole nine pianos and four phonographs from one railway company
in a large city, and to date six had been recovered. Claims arising from
damage, delay, theft, loss and wrecks are traffic men’s enemies that play the
mischief and filter through all departments to the chief legal authorities.
Of late years the railway companies have been stimulated to eternal vigilance
in order to combat daring robbers with confederate organization quite far
reaching and involving from twenty to forty people within the ranks of employees
and outside. Such a gang is said to have stolen from one company in
four months goods valued at $35,000, comprising candy, cameras, sugar,
liquors, musical instruments and clothing. The investigation departments
have recovered from beneath hay stacks not far from Toronto, Canada, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
instance, forty suits of underwear and a dozen pairs of ladies high suede boots.
Imagine the temerity of the men making off with twenty head of sheep from
under the eyes of yardmen and special officers. The public press not long
ago chronicled details of the loss of fifteen sacks of flour from one car en route
Buffalo to Belleville. Whiskey is an outstanding temptation and many a
headache that starts rolling fails to join the soda waiting at the other end.
Out of a thirty case consignment from further west, making the one night
journey from St. Thomas to Black Rock, there checked fifteen cases missing,
lock, stock and barrel—the wood only of four cases remained and eleven cases
were intact. Unmerited onus for losses is now and then thought to rest with
the railroads which enquiry does not substantiate. A well known firm in the
congested wholesale zone of a neighboring city engaged a detective who pussy-footed
about the premises for a year without locating a leak. This human
bloodhound may have had a cold in his head and was a poor scenter as it was
developed later that the shortages were manipulated as a side line by a vinegar
mill shipper who got away with also $6,000 of the hardened cider—mostly recovered—and
had been supplying a small pickle factory through the medium
of a carter who drove up daily for kegs.</p>

<p>Railway companies very seldom pilfer, but the action of more than one
railroad on this continent in appropriating urgently needed steam coal billed
to others during the winters of 1917–18, will prepare the reader’s viewpoint
for a claim for reimbursement placed in the hands of the Silverplate Road,
covering fifty cars of slack coal, lost and being vigorously traced, which that line
had seized and hastily dumped into a big washout cavity.</p>

<p>Whitewashing coal would seem to be a labor as unheard of as washing the
spots off the leopard, yet, says the Saturday Evening Post, that apparently
crazy scheme is carried out by some western railroads. The coal is whitewashed,
not for aesthetic reasons, but simply to prevent theft in transit. Before
a car of coal starts on its journey the top layers are sprayed with limewater,
which leaves a white coating on each lump of black coal after the water evaporates.
The removal of even a small quantity from that whitewashed layer is
immediately detected, so that the exact junction or station at which the theft
occurred can be noticed.</p>

<p>Once upon a time when many boys were investigating the fallacy of the
supposed transformation of a black horse hair into a snake after nine days sojourn
in the rain barrel, a loaded oil tank car was glued to the rails in Detroit
yards, but urgently needed on the other side of the international boundary.
Giving a clear receipt, a connecting line hooked on to it, but almost immediately
finding the tank in a leaking condition because the discharge pipe had been
snapped in a rough shunt, they shot it back to the original carriers. The
latter were on guard and refused it, the tank in the meantime losing 200 gallons
of oil. To aggravate matters, a third railway whose office was to deliver the
shipment, looked askance at the “cripple” and thus both exits were closed.
Despite the pleadings of the consignees for the oil, the middle line holding the
“white elephant” turned to them a deaf ear until a settlement would be made.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
After much fencing and correspondence an adjustment on a mileage basis was
arrived at. The road accepting the “bad order” tank was held liable for a
proportion gauged by a thirty mile haul, and the comparatively innocent delivering
company, being ten miles longer, drew a debit of $4,000.</p>

<p>The interpretation of a maze of tariff rates and a thousand lights and
shadows affecting their application, as well as classification, deadlocks regarding
analogous goods perplex and keep bright the wits of railway people, that
the responsibility may be placed where it should rest. To elucidate this remark
let me refer in passing, to a partly demented and very undependable dealer in
a commodity that was barrelled—long since gone to his reward—who requested
and obtained a quotation on a specific shipment of twenty cars, each to contain
a stated number of barrels, which were to be of agreed size and weight.
He then had made a larger barrel, forwarded the product in them and, of course,
when weighed a heavy undercharge claim developed, the carriers holding the
short end.</p>

<p>Different from this was the experience of a car of eastbound California
oranges traveling via the gorges and canyons of a Rocky Mountain railway.
A broken axle precipitated trouble in the middle of the train which threw the
“cripple” out of alignment and in shorter time than is consumed in relating it,
the down-grade impetus and pressure wrenched it free throwing the disabled
car clear. It fell to the bottom of the gorge, the automatic couplers linked
the drawheads of the separated halves of the train and no one was wiser until
the following springtime freshets uncovered the debris at the base of a cliff,
clearing up a mystery for the checkers and claim department.</p>

<p>Sparks from passing locomotives do widespread damage to crops and fencing
and a battalion of agents are continually engrossed with personal injury
matters and destruction of stock. A car of expensive western steers was
recently heading eastward to the seaboard when early in the morning prairie
grass in the racks of troughs igniting from sparks started a blaze. Being under
way, the crew did not detect the trouble at once but, on learning the danger,
they raced to the water tank at Ingersoll. Before the water was reached a
draw bar pulled out and broke setting the emergency brakes hard, jolting the
train to a sudden stop. Fifteen head of the cattle were found roasted to death
and three jumped from the car and ran amuck crazed with blisters and the intense
heat. Railroading is not all profit. Some days you cannot lay up a
cent. The following true story is <span class="locked">apropos:—</span></p>

<p>“How many cows have you now?” inquired the visitor.</p>

<p>“Eight,” replied Farmer Corntossel, discontentedly; “all comin’ home
reg’lar every night to make work for somebody.”</p>

<p>“I understand two of your neighbor’s cows got hit by railway trains last
week.”</p>

<p>“Yep. An’ he got cash fur ’em, too. I don’t see how that feller trains
his cattle not to shy at a locomotive.”—<cite>Washington Star.</cite></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>When the public magnifies the cash returns from ticket sales and freight
traffic it has not an accurate conception of the immense sums paid out annually
by the railway companies for the adjustment of even small claims. Traffic
Manager Adam Scott of the F. W. Woolworth Company, with eighty-five
stores in Canada, was instrumental in having authorized during the past fiscal
year $16,000 in vouchers issued to write off small claims on less than carload
shipments of glassware and crockery. This firm controls nine hundred and
ninety-eight stores in America and the sums involved in this phase of profit
and loss must be immense.</p>

<p>On one occasion the Great Northern Railway wrote the Heinz Pickle
Company, Leamington, Ont., regarding the collection of an undercharge
amounting to $40.09, which arose from an error in prepaying the freight charges
on a carload shipped to Vancouver, B.C. The Pickle Company’s Traffic Manager,
at Pittsburg, Pa., working in accordance with the Inter-state Commerce
Act Rules, promptly acknowledged the liability in an elaborate statement,
with cheque, assuring the railway company that the correct amount of the
discrepancy was, on further investigation, found to be $80.45. In other days
we all knew some people who would have gasped at such an evidence of gratuitous
fair dealing, but to quote from William Shakespeare, the listener would
be fit for “treason, stratagem and spoils” whose risibilities are not tickled
with a recital of the claim of a cautious old sexton, made on the Canadian
Northern Railway at Winnipeg for two funeral tollings at $2 each which he
would have received had the railway delivered the expected church bell in
time. And so the old world and the amusing people on it, with their pleasantries
and foibles, roll across the stage of every-day existence.</p>

<span class="subhead small">Traveling Agent, Grand Trunk Railway, on the occasion of his marriage,
Hamilton, Canada, May 27th, 1912</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“We</span> must encourage the young,” said a former acquaintance of your
father—a benevolent old benedict—who cheerfully swung into
line with the friends wishing to mark your approaching marriage
and who would honor you with more than the sentiments expressed herein.</p>

<p>The matrimonial contract of that railroading knight is nearing completion;
yours is about to be undertaken with ideals, hope and resolve. Undoubtedly
the trail will develop many joys and some kinks in the path, but we
are convinced that you can measure up to the best traditions of the lords
of creation. Those who have basked in the rays of your genial personality
prophecy you will prove docile “In bond” and all of us will “Watch your
smoke.”</p>

<p>You spring from sturdy stock, long identified with railway construction
in Canada, and since those other days in the loft of Hamilton’s smoke smeared
freight shed, down the avenue of occupations in your native city, abroad in
Western Ontario and throughout the business zone of Toronto, few dare
question your reputation for urbanity, commercial sense and thoroughness.
Where master and man wrest for silver fortunes in Cobalt Camp, they say
your methods and diplomatic behavior were “as smooth as a kitten’s wrist”
and a decided asset to the Grand Trunk Railway.</p>

<p>As a reminder of your bachelor days and associations: as a token of regard
when nearing the threshold of a momentous event in your life, accept from
subscribing friends whose names are attached hereto, the accompanying
gift of dining room furniture—a contribution towards your household gods.</p>

<p>To the estimable lady who is to become Mrs. Nelson, please convey our
profound respect; we presume her journey from Brockville to Hamilton will
be a personally conducted tour. You both have our earnest and best wishes
for a happy future.</p>

<p>T.T.—Mercy Mister, this is terryble, give me a ticket to Moffat’s Corners.</p>

<p>T.C.—Can’t give you one, but I will sell it.</p>

<p>T.T.—Why is my train arriving so late?</p>

<p>T.C.—It’s just like this: the train ahead is behind, and this train was behind
before besides.</p>

<p>T.T.—Ma’ conscience!</p>

to the yard limits and was seated in a free reclining chair car waiting for a

<p>Speaking of “Back talk” at a railwaymen’s dinner, President Howard
Elliott of the New Haven Lines, expressed sympathy for an employee temporarily
under unbearable conditions and explained that when the conductor was
punching tickets a man said to him, with a nasty sneer—“You have a lot of

<p>“Ho! Ho! merry men and molasses is it? We’ll feed them the syrup to
sweeten their tempers after the Redskins scalp their cow-licks and curly-me-Q’s,”
the Ottawas’ chief exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Your bunch of pretenders would grade about Tenth in the Western
Classification and that’s the tariff rating the railways give sand, bricks and
other heavy, commodities” answered the director of the Green Sox.</p>

<p>“Believe me, President you have a raft of flotsom and jetsom as variegated
as a hedge of Sweet William; a flock of tortoises I call them,” responded the
ladylike O’Toole, appropriating the last word.</p>

<p>However, “Opinion is private property which the law cannot seize,”
the old saw says.</p>

<p>As with all other mortals of divers pursuits, these ball tossers can stand just
so much baiting and then they bristle like an old cock when young chantecler
invades his yard reaching for high C. With plenty of such good natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
badinage and the dissemination of unlimited sunshine, the owners and managers
of the clubs composing the Inter-lake League finished the early spring meeting
convened to arrange the games schedule for the current season, making due
allowance for national holidays and discussing railway fares with ticket agents
Jack Campbell, Albert Craig and J. B. Doran. This league comprised the
Brantford Green Socks, Knotty Lee’s Hamilton Bengal Tigers, Saints of St.
Thomas, home town of Bob. Emslie, National League umpire, and Gladstone
Graney with Lajoie’s Cleveland “Naps”; also the Cockneys of London, where
Pittsburg Pirate George Gibson dwells neighborly beside the railway triumvirate
Messrs. Ernie Ruse, Harry MacCallum and Hubert Hays, with Ottawas
of Ottawa and Peterborough Blue Jays completing the roster. The rivalry
and fortunes of the bustling sextette, as will later be seen, ebbed and flowed
between Brantford, the hub of two thirds of the circuit, presided over by president
Silent Thomas Nelson, C.P.A., G.T.R., nick-named the “Sphinx” for his
wisdom and ability to guard a secret deal, as far east as Ottawa on the big river
where Claudius O’Toole had cajoled and berated his henchmen into winning
the bunting the season before.</p>

<p>When the present Mr. O’Toole was yet a squalling infant the suffering,
patient sponsors saw to it that his name was set down in the vestry register as
“Claudius” with the saint’s name Dominick added, but the creepy nickname
“Spider” automatically clung to “Claude” like the monkey man to the neck of
the famous Sinbad the sailor who figured in Arabian Nights. The youth
grew rangy, with long shifty legs, and his arms, ornamented with grapplers,
seemingly as numerous and resourceful as the tentacles of a cuttle fish, were
the wonder and pride of the freshmen at St. Augustine’s Seminary who doted
on his prowess and perennial good nature.</p>

<p>At all times an awed respecter of Irish tradition, Spider O’Toole reverenced
St. Patrick’s memory in full measure, and like that venerable sainted
man, could not tolerate anything that wriggled: and who could blame him.
The word “cringe” was not in his encyclopaedia and as he never “crawled”
himself, he abhorred spiders and snakes as the devil scowls on piety. With
him they were as popular as a horse thief in Utah. His dislike for cobras,
constrictors, rattlers and all that ilk that do the hesitation glide without legs,
was no spasmodic, abnormal antipathy, mark you, born of flirtations with the
grape when purple, for he had never been known to arrive at a condition superinduced
by an over-indulgence in the bottled and popular elements of conviviality.
Always a man of nerve and aggressiveness, he shunned those toy cameras
and fake electric pocket flashes, concealing jumping adders as he would
the wails of the family Banshee, while buggy whips and garden hose lying
about in the gloaming were sure to send shivers gamboling up and down his
spinal network. Naturalists tell us the sagacious elephant, big as he is, will
promptly side-step a lizard—and why not?</p>

<p>One rainy evening after the teams of the Inter-lake League had rid themselves
of Charley-horse, glass arms and proud flesh, and were schooled and
whipped into tolerable fettle for the ordeal of endurance and dexterity, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the opening day a short week off, Thomas Nelson, President of the Green Sox,
met Spider O’Toole with others of the clan in the Algonquin Hotel rotunda.
With them were Francis Nelson, Sporting Editor of the Globe, Dick Kearns,
Fitzgerald and Charlie Good, and near by in the billiard room Harry Thorley
and Billy Hamilton were making some fancy shots with a party they were
booking to Europe, via the L.V.R. and White Star Line. Said Thomas quite
carelessly, to Claudius, as he shifted the position of an undiscernable portion
of Piper Heidseick from one cheek to the other, “We think we have better than
an even break with the Ottawas on dates for the season’s schedule Mr. O’Toole:
in other words, my Christian friend, I have the edge on you.”</p>

<p>Oh, have you Mr. Sphinx—well don’t strain your diaphragm gloating over
that paper advantage: I’ll dull your edge so badly that you will have your
spavined free lances at the horse shoers in a month, I will, so I will and I’ll
leave it to your friend Ira Thomas, Mitch. Thomas or St. Thomas.</p>

<p>“I trow not, Spider. We have gathered in the net as fine a cluster of
brilliants as ever crossed the Giant’s Causeway since the days the Gauls hung
to the branches with their tails. I hope Connie Mack is unaware of their
speed.”</p>

<p>“Mr. McGillicudy is still a young man: too bad to have him choke to death
with laughter and he in his prime,” commented Claudius O’Toole.</p>

<p>“The Green Stockings are a lot of limber base ball professors, bright as
patent stove polish, and when your kindergarten is introduced to their science.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Will. Connell and Harry Watkins with the “Great Northern”,
who had just come in from the theatre after enjoying Dick Sheridan’s
“School for Scandal”, naively enquired if Mr. O’Toole’s redskins would win
their opening game with the Peterborough Bluejays a week hence, adding
“The birds are touted tough as hickory and hard nuts to crack”.</p>

<p>“We’ll crack their kernels as sure as Hades is a man trap,” said the Spider,
“or make them work so hard they’ll ferment and blow their heads off.”</p>

<p>“As a precaution, have your willie pink collegians remove their hobble
skirts,” chimed in Tom the Sphinx, with a significant smile.</p>

<p>“If the Bluejays loom such a menace to our aspirations, gentlemen,”
retorted O’Toole, with a twinkle in his eye, “my humorous contemporary of
the Brantford Green Legs had better buy nine shrouds now and fix a date for
the wake.”</p>

<p>“Too much levity Spider, too much levity: ‘a sooty chimney spoileth
many a beefsteak’. Do be advised” continued Nelson, childlike and bland.
“The Green Sox team has one batter who is a potential phenomenon. On
a clear day he can propel the sphere across the lagoon to the Cape Verde Islands
and make it sizzle so that the natives think it is a Jack Johnson or a sputtering
meteor from Mars.”</p>

<p>This was intended to spike the mortar of the rangy collegian but it didn’t.</p>

<p>“See here, Mr. President, be careful that no one hangs crepe on your nose
or the public will get on to the fact that your brain is dead”, was the response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet Senator, the Irishmen will stitch up your savages so neatly they
will be about as effective as a camera fiend in a London fog.”</p>

<p>“If that strain is put on us,” cried O’Toole, “I’ll ride a slippery log over
the Chaudiere Dam at Ottawa and you can be there to see from the bridge
north of the Chateau Laurier.” And he wished later there was bark on that
log.</p>

<p>Some one said “Would you indulge in a mild libation if properly approached?”
and a wag you all know said “We do not know you well enough
to refuse you, is the gentleman with the ‘still’ exclusive?”</p>

<p>“So exclusive, my boy,” was the reply, “that you have to be both a True
Blue and a Knight of Columbus to gain an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entree</i>”, and with that their voices
died away in the distance.</p>

<p>Tim Mullins, Mel. Thomson and Jim Edwards of the G.T.R., who came
up from Ottawa said at dinner the day Peterborough and Ottawa clashed that
Spider O’Toole refused spaghetti because it squirmed and slid off his fork like
the tempter in the Garden of Eden and he finished the meal without ridding
himself of a half-defined presentment of evil. It beats the Dutch what odd
little whims and superstitious notions some of those base ball players cherish
and permit to influence their daily actions and fortunes.</p>

<p>Try to develop on the film of your memory the picture of a moderately
expansive diamond and outfield, the grass exceptionally abundant on account
of the adjacent moisture and the entire enclosure surrounded by the shapely
maple and a variety of other trees adorned with vivid spring foliage. Include
in the perspective the hurrying, foamy waters of the serpentine Otonabee River
flanking the parkside before spreading wide to the harbor beyond and you
glimpse the arena where Claudius O’Toole lost his first game to the merciless
Bluejays and likewise his wager.</p>

<p>These were the home grounds of the Peterborough Bluejays, and the players
located on the chessboard as strategetically as might be, were there “with the
lard in their hair,” eager to circumvent the Ottawa nine and provide an interesting
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">premiere</i> that afternoon for their supporters who buzzed with expectancy
and speculation, tier over tier, as the early innings progressed.</p>

<p>Jim Skinner and E. T. Carr encouraged the Jays, and in the telegraph
cupola where Tony Webster was at the key, sat Jimmie Anderson, Jack Tinning
and John Melville, hoping to ticket the players to Western Ontario.</p>

<p>Considerable betting and some odds had been laid here and there on the
result among the fans and normal local adherents, and in several outside quarters
anticipation was keen, but down in the reeds and stone piles beside the
rushing eddies, where a large water snake and his partner were basking with
several smaller amphibious creatures in the sunshine, nothing was known of
all this. The pair in sable and bronze habiliments, displaying the activity and
boldness peculiar to the breed in mating season and their need of food after
long hibernation, were fearlessly foraging beside the sedge at the river’s edge,
and woe betide the luckless chub in the shallows or lazy frog on shore caught
napping. The ball ground outfield ran down close to the river, terminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
at a high fence, and was uniform and level save for a few depressions in the
black loam where was once a swamp. Owing to the dampness and shade the
grass refused to grow hereabouts. The game progressed with tantalizing
uncertainty until the pivotal seventh innings, the advantage resting first with
the Bluejays and then with the Redskins. At this point the Ottawas gained
the ascendancy with a batting rally and Spider O’Toole, who played deep
centre field, worked closer in stimulating his men with “Ginger up Germany,
to the youth at second—you can’t coax a living from the public on that form.”
And again, to the young spitball pitcher, “Steady Slim, nice work lad, take
your time, you have them coming and going as easy as pulling on an old glove.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the eighth inning the score stood 4-4 and the Spider’s
braves in their half of the ninth chalked up but one more circuit as the Bluejays,
though nervous did not crack and were making no costly errors. The
stands began to rumble as the home players went to bat for the last time, a
boy clinging to an over-hanging branch called “Oh Mr. O’Toole, we’ll make
you take your gruel” and the palpable excitement of some of the ladies who
were on their feet, caused otherwise sober spectators to turn the meeting into
temporary pandemonium with waving arms, hats and vocal extravagances.
M. J. Baker and his friend Jamieson, came with the saints, and the stentorian
tones of Stanton A. Baker, representing the “Great Western”, calling the plays
to Tommie Gormally and Harvey Hagerman over at Oshawa, could be plainly
heard above the din.</p>

<p>In the midst of the uproar Eddie D—— and his acquaintance O. G. C.
Willard, faultlessly attired, when passing the grand stand, and thus perchance
unconsciously giving the ladies a treat, overheard an Old Country friend with
John Ransford exclaim,</p>

<p>“Aw, my word, this is a strange game!”</p>

<p>“How so strange?” queried John.</p>

<p>“The players seem to have an unlimited license to indulge in personalities,
don’t you know—hear how they ‘rat’ each other!”</p>

<p>“They don’t mean it, those boys are milk-fed, college-bred, and the salt
of the earth”, explained the sage from Clinton.</p>

<p>“My Eye, observe the pitcher and catcher are even now conspiring to beat
the batter”, continued the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is only camouflage to deceive the enemy,” replied his host.
The visitor’s marked impartiality towards the stubborn progress of the contending
teams recalls the attitude of the lady whose husband was in mortal
combat with a grizzly bear, exclaiming, “I never saw a fight I cared so little
about who won”.</p>

<p>As was prognosticated, the heavy hitter to Cape Verde Islands arose to
the occasion and smacked a fair one on the nose to left which the fielder fumbled.
He lead off a dozen feet and made second with a hook slide when a foul tip
clipped the catchers’ finger and the ball rolled to the screen. The tension
increased. From where he stood, legs apart and watchful, O’Toole stormed
and upbraided at the top of his voice, swearing by the web-footed, bald-headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Siamese twins, while the pitcher and backstop conferred. The umpire’s indicator
shewed two men on bases and no one out when the third birdman stepped
over to the plate and stood motionless as Sejanus on his horse. His plan or
the captain’s orders counseled a waiting policy, and such patience was repaid
with four balls, earning first base, forcing his mates and filling the bags. Whoops
and yells tore jagged holes in the atmosphere, and even momentarily disconcerted
the fourth and last friendly batter. “Slim” threw him a swift ball at
which he swung to no purpose, and it lodged with a resounding plop in the
cavity of the catcher’s mitt. Again the man on the mound moistened the now
soiled horsehide and repeated the performance, but the strain was terrific and
his features registered it plainly. The next one was low and wide. Once
more he threw, transmitting decided curve to the sphere, but it lacked sustained
velocity and slowed down in progress. The waiting batter saw his opportunity,
breathed a fervent “Welcome Mr. Spalding” and received it squarely. The
ball sailed over the pitcher’s head and past the shortstop’s clutching digits just
at the instant Spider O’Toole was vociferating “Oh, you son of a snail”. This
compliment to the exhausted “Slim” smothered in his mouth as he realized
the sphere was heading to his territory. True to instinct, his tentacular mechanism
sprang alert and making a sanguine, mighty vault his fingers just
touched the ball, the contact and a puff of wind diverting its course and down
it came behind him not far off. The dirty ball ceased rolling two yards away,
resting in one of those shady, somewhat deep hollows in the black loam close
to the river bank and fence. Alive to the crucial situation quivering at half
cock on the diamond and savagely intent on thwarting the runners as well as
to maintain his lead, the Spider spun round in a flash of time and half blindly
leaping on the dirty horsehide stumbled, falling at full length face down as his
hand closed over the coveted ball.</p>

<p>O ye hooting witches of the midnight orgy and screeching jagaurs squirming
in the fatal coils of Columbian pythons, never was there such a scream and
succession of fearful cries emitted as arose from the prostrate player rolling
over and over before the multitude in an agonized struggle to right himself.
The approaching bay of a hungry winter wolf pack in full tongue is unequalled
as a shudder producer and fearful indeed, our ancestors say, were the howls
of redskins bent on massacre. The field and stand had never listened to these,
but they heard Spider O’Toole and were transfixed with thrills in speechless
anticipation. Wild eyed and sweating they found him, the grimey ball still
in his grasp and two water snakes wound about his wrist and forearm with
ugly heads and forked tongues shooting this way and that as their bodies
writhed and rubbed his bare skin in efforts to free themselves from his powerful
clutch, poor O’Toole dancing in near convulsions, meanwhile beseeching
the rescuers to free him from the loathsome girdle. It would appear that the
reptiles had come out of the water, as they sometimes do, and after the manner
of their kind, curled up together and gone to sleep in one of the swampy depressions
close to the fence bounding extreme centre field, and this was the handful
the fingers of Claudius O’Toole closed on. The shortstop and fielder who
first reached their horrified leader state <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sub rosa</i> that he was muttering pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
of prayers, swearing on the bones of King Kelly, and vowing by Ptolemy’s
ancient mummies that he would nail those flying runners at the plate. In
his wanderings he was heard to mention “Log over the Chaudiere”, “See their
flat, evil heads” and “St. Patrick to the rescue”.</p>

<p>When the commotion subsided and the contented Peterboroughese were
discussing the absorbing topic on their way home, Mister O’Toole disrobed
in the dressing room and while introducing his friends Gerald O’Flaherty and
Jimmie Goodall to Mr. Nelson, declared by all the hairy chested “oorang
ootangs” in the Zambesi Country that he would in future manage his team from
the bench when they clashed with the Bluejays at home. Therefore you may
not view Spider O’Toole in action again beside the winding Otonabee River,
but sooner or later, he will emulate a spike-heeled river driver with peavie in
hand, riding a pine log over the Chaudiere in order that a pound of flesh may
be delivered to Silent Tom Nelson, President of the Brantford Green Sox.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
